            Okay so you’re probably reading this because you want to up your excel skills because… well, it’s important in the job market and you want to land an awesome job at Goldman Sachs this summer.  Or not. Look, it’s important to have awesome Excel skills no matter if you’re working for a bank, in tech, at a hospital or at a nonprofit. I’m going to give you one simple tool that will change the way you use Excel forever (hopefully). Here it is (and you have to be on Windows for it to work): Use the Alt key! You’ll probably see some letters pop up along the “ribbon,” now hit one of those letters on your keyboard, and now another until it does something. Hopefully you’ve figured out that this is a quick way to navigate through the various settings in Excel and will use this tip in the future. Check out the file below for a small list of really useful Excel shortcuts that you should commit to memory. Check out this YouTube video for a video explanation:

          <p class="excel-sub-description-text">
            No matter which career path you choose to pursue, knowing how to create a pivot table on Excel is of the upmost importance. A pivot table serves as a useful tool because it can:
            <ol>
              <li>Summarize data into a compact, understandable format</li>
              <li>Help find relationships in data</li>
              <li>Organize the data in a format that’s easy to chart</li>
            </ol>
            Furthermore, pivot tables can help ensure that you are provided with accurate, useful data, which is easily accessible for analysis. They also serve as a great tool in double-checking that you, the user, are asking the right questions of the available data and are carrying out the analysis with the appropriate tools. While there are far more complex analytic tools within Excel, pivot tables remain popular because of their user-friendly nature. Using pivot tables guarantees convenience for all parties involved in the data analytics process. If you want to learn how to create pivot tables, check out this video!

          <p class="excel-sub-description-text">
            Excel spreadsheets and tables can be very intimidating to the user or editor, as they often contain hundreds of rows or columns of data. Using the HLookup or VLookup functions can help sort through a myriad of information quickly and effectively.
            <ol>
              <li>Lookup functions help find specific names, numbers, or figures</li>
              <li>They can also produce values based on certain criteria</li>
              <li>Lastly, they can be convenient to use as they have simple cell inputs, just like regular functions.</li>
            </ol>
            Lookup functions are especially useful for large tables full of data. In other cases, one may use a lookup function to use one column of functions to produce another. For example, if one has a grading scale (0-64=F, 65+=P) they can use HLookup or VLookup to produce F’s or P’s depending on the preceding column or row’s values. Finally lookup functions are relatively easy to configure and are easy to catch on to, with a little practice of course. If you would like to learn more about these specific lookup functions, I would highly recommend that you watch some videos!

          <p class="excel-sub-description-text">
            The next skills we will be looking at are Goal Seek and Solver. These are excellent analysis tools that will come in handy when managing scenarios with changing variables. The Goal Seek function allows you to specify a desired output and will in turn calculate the necessary input values to reach your determined output. It is very useful for quickly solving formulas with a single unknown value. If you've used the Solver on the TI-83+ calculator, the method is very similar. Next, is the more complex version of Goal Seek: Solver. Excel's Solver utility is a more powerful and flexible version of the Goal Seek utility. It accommodates multiple unknowns, multiple equations, and is able to optimize under-constrained solutions based on multiple constraints.
