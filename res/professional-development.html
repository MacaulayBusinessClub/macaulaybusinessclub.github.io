            The key to any interview is preparation. Interviewers want to know that you have spent time reflecting on your experiences and are able to eloquently speak about them. They also want to see that you are interested in the company. Interviewers often test your interest in acquiring the position by testing your knowledge of the company.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here are some tips to help you prepare for that important interview:
            <ul>
              <br>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Know your resume inside and out</span>
                <br><span style="padding: 0 2em;">Everything on it is fair game, and slipping up on details can cost you the job. You should have examples to back up the accomplishments you have written. Use the STAR method (Situation/Task, Action you took, Result) for these examples.
              </span></li>
              <br>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Know about the company</span>
                <br><span style="padding: 0 2em;">You should know company leaders, like the CEO or the person that runs the division you are applying to. It is also important to know any recent news about the company. A quick Google search should give you all the information you need. It goes without saying, but you should know about the job you are applying for as well. You should be aware of an employee’s responsibilities and the types of projects you might work on. Speaking to current employees is the best way to get accurate information, and it also portrays your interest in the company.</span>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Present a holistic understanding of the industry</span>
                <br><span style="padding: 0 2em;">You should be able to speak about any major events/trends in the industry of the company you are interviewing for.</span>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Finally, don’t be afraid to have a story about your weekend or free time</span>
                <br><span style="padding: 0 2em;">It can be anything from a good restaurant you went to, a book you enjoyed, or a ski trip. When you first meet your interviewer, chances are that they will ask you how your weekend was or how you are. Rather than giving a generic answer, tell a short story about something interesting you may have done. This can give the interviewer some color on your personality and even shed light on common interests. At the end of the day, an interview is a conversation and it helps to be interesting.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            After practicing these tips in front of friends, family or even a mirror, interviews should be a breeze! Being prepared is always a plus… just don’t sound/act like a robot.
