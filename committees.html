          <p class="main-descriptive-text">The Event Coordination team is responsible for running the logistics for upcoming events and reaching out to a wide variety of professionals from our networks. This committee reserves rooms with administration, creates timelines and presentations for events, reaches out to other organizations for co-sponsorships, and make sure the events run smoothly. Contacting professionals is important for our events and for expanding the MBC network.</p>

          <h4 class="subheader-text">Content Creation</h4>
          <p class="main-descriptive-text">The Content Creation team allows MBC members to publish original articles onto the MBC website. This initiative ensures that members are able to effectively communicate and discuss current events, and provides a necessary stepping stone in their continued professional development. In addition, members are encouraged to share valuable resources, such as interview tips and career opportunities, with their peers. In doing so, members hope to share information that can help build the vital skills that will allow others to succeed in their professional pursuits.

          <h4 class="subheader-text">Web Development</h4>
          <p class="main-descriptive-text">The Web Development team leads the development of the Macaulay Business Club website by experimenting with different languages and designs to create, test and develop an interactive and user-friendly interface. The teamâ€™s primary focus is on front-end development and team members are highly encouraged to take steps to learn computer programming. Programming is not a required skill to have to be part of the web team. However, a passion and a willingness to learn about web design and development is more than admirable trait of the web team. We work together to build something great.</p>
