    "post_content": "<h5>Collin Chipetine<\/h5>\r\n<h5>March 22, 2017<\/h5>\r\nAIG recently revealed its fourth quarter earnings, which reported losses totaling approximately $3.04 billion, a loss marked as “the worst performance by the New York City-based firm since its near-collapse in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.” In response, AIG and its Chief Executive made a drastic decision in allowing the current CEO, Peter Hancock, to step down.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/AIG.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-320 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/AIG-300x245.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"245\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Investopedia<\/p>\r\nAlthough he was CEO of AIG for less than three years, Hancock had lofty plans from the start of his time with the firm. One of these plans included returning $25 billion to shareholders through a combined effort of share buybacks and a consistent dividend stream for two years. This goal was ahead of schedule with returns of $13.1 billion to its shareholders by the end of 2016. Despite these efforts, after a couple of days of trading at a plunge of almost 9% prior to the Q4 results an at only 85% of AIG’s entire stated assets value, Hancock wasn’t the only one concerned about his position at AIG.\r\n\r\nIn times such as these for companies as large as AIG, it is easy to turn to the leadership as the main cause of such a crash. This of course is not always the case, but nevertheless, begins to make people question whether a change should be made to preserve the progress of the company. This was exactly the case for Hancock, claiming even without the full support of AIG’s shareholders, he felt it was both in his own self-interest and in the interest of the greater organization to not further undermine the growth of the firm. While the CEO succeeding Hancock will be the sixth in just 12 years for AIG, many investors and shareholders do agree that it is in fact the best solution for the organization as a whole. Carl Ichan, the fourth largest investor in AIG, stood fully behind this change of leadership.\r\n\r\nAs expected, shareholders are skeptical of a new leader’s ability to progress the company as needed. At the point, AIG’s goal is to decrease the volume of its balance sheet through several deals to shrink or sell parts of the company. Hancock himself had even had a combined 17 deals to shrink the company overall to just over $498 billion half of its value in 2007, when it took such a devastating blow following the recession. With almost a 5% stake in the company, Ichan frequently states his ideas for a more regulated supervision of the company, even if that means taking on more capital. In order to take all of these ideas and goals and put them into action, AIG must be diligent in who they choose to succeed Hancock.\r\n\r\nHancock has agreed to stay on until his successor is chosen, in hopes of avoiding any damage that can be dealt to its shareholders’ interests resulting from such uncertainty. Regardless of whom AIG chooses to fill the shoes of Hancock, the firm’s main priority will be to continue shedding assets and reducing risk in order to avoid repetition of the 2007-2008 crisis. Much is unknown, but one thing that is a definite for AIG is that these next few upcoming weeks will be crucial to the future of the company.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2017\/03\/09\/aig-ceo-peter-hancock-step-down-after-massive-loss-insurance-giant\/98946930\/\">http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2017\/03\/09\/aig-ceo-peter-hancock-step-down-after-massive-loss-insurance-giant\/98946930\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-aig-moves-ceo-idUSKBN16G1RB\">http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-aig-moves-ceo-idUSKBN16G1RB<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "Avi Goldman\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 2017\r\n\r\nWith professional sports around the world reaching the height of their popularity, team valuations have begun to explode. In July 2016, Forbes published an article listing the most valuable sports franchises in the world, which was led by the Dallas Cowboys football team at $4 billion. That’s $1.37B more than your friendly-neighborhood GameStop (NYSE:GME). So what is it about sports teams that makes them so valuable? Let’s examine one specific NBA team, the New York Knicks, for example. The Knicks make money from their portion of the television deals the league has with Turner Sports and ESPN ($240M), their huge market ($1.456B), the money generated by MSG (ticket sales, non-basketball events, premium attractions, etc.) ($907M) and their specific brand ($447 M). All of those add up to a team valuation of ~$3 Billion. Reading that Forbes article got me thinking: why don’t sports teams offer shares on the public markets?\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/NBA-Image.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-291 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/NBA-Image-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>Source: espn.com<\/p>\r\nAs we just saw, buying a sports franchise is an expensive endeavor, one usually reserved for billionaires and the ultra-connected, but need that be the case? Why can’t franchise-owners, like CEOs that IPO their companies, look to the public markets to raise funds for a new stadium or to go after a highly-coveted free agent? What sports fan wouldn’t be interested in becoming a part-owner of their favorite team, even if they only owned a fraction of a percent? If they are worried about inexperienced outsiders ruining their team, the ownership group could set up the public shares in such a way that they do not allow the holders to vote on team matters, similar to how Snap, Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) offered theirs.\r\n\r\nWhile there have been instances in the past when teams have offered shares and underperformed the market, I believe that an equitable arrangement that allows investors to share in the financial gains and appreciation of the teams will solve this problem. In 2012, Business Insider published a piece titled “The Fastest Growing Sports Franchises Since 2000.” In it, they detailed teams that grew by over 200% over the 12-year period, a period in which the S&amp;P 500 had growth of less than 50%. A team’s valuation would undoubtedly be highly cyclical based on its recent performance (which would without a doubt impact all aspects of its revenue stream), but in the same way that value investors find the neglected stocks bound to soar, the smart money would see past the struggles of today and buy into the bright future.\r\n\r\nWhile there are, without a doubt, still issues that need to be resolved with this idea, I believe that such an offering would be attractive to both fans seeking to join in their team’s success and investors seeking above-market returns.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<u>Sources<\/u>:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/sports-franchises-triple-value-2012-7?op=1\/#-new-york-yankees-8\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/sports-franchises-triple-value-2012-7?op=1\/#-new-york-yankees-8<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/chrissmith\/2012\/08\/10\/manchester-united-ipo-history-says-dont-buy\/2\/#26bf237c7e49\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/chrissmith\/2012\/08\/10\/manchester-united-ipo-history-says-dont-buy\/2\/#26bf237c7e49<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/pictures\/mli45fgemg\/1-dallas-cowboys\/#6652b1db17b5\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/pictures\/mli45fgemg\/1-dallas-cowboys\/#6652b1db17b5<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=&amp;referrer=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#49a66450444f\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=&amp;referrer=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#49a66450444f<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "by Chandrapaul Latchman\r\n\r\nEbay meets Amazon meets PayPal. That’s what pundits are calling China’s hottest technology company, Alibaba. With just days away from its Initial Public Offering (IPO), Alibaba is slated to draw in $24.3bn, according to the Wall St. Journal.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who aren’t so finance savvy, an IPO is essentially taking a private company public. The company, in this case Alibaba, hires an investment bank, which seeks investors to buy shares, or ownership, of the company. The investment bankers are responsible for pricing the shares and use a variety of methods to come up with that price. The shares are then issued to the public and traded on the secondary market (this is what we call the stock market).\r\nSo what does Alibaba actually do? Well, they are a Chinese e-commerce company with a twist. You can literally buy anything under the sun, from fresh fruit to electric tools to automobiles. The service is B2B (business to business) transactions, as most of the products are sold in bulk. If that’s the Amazon part, then the eBay element is that there are literally thousands upon thousands of suppliers from all over the world and you can negotiate the price on goods if you buy enough items.\r\n\r\nThe element that most resembles PayPal is Alipay. This is possibly the most telling of exactly how large Alibaba is. Average daily transaction volume of Alipay is $298mm, that’s every day of the year people! In comparison, PayPal has a daily transaction volume of $397mm, so it looks like Alibaba still has some ways to grow before it can catch this giant.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is set to IPO on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “BABA” and as of September 5th, 2014 share price is expected to be $60-$66. Personally, I think it’s great to have some more competition in the tech space because more competition always means better prices and more differentiated service for the customer.\r\n\r\nWould you buy in? I have to say I’m bullish on Alibaba, due primarily to their 43% operating margin. In comparison, Amazon’s operating margin is 0%. How do you feel about this Chinese company IPO-ing in NYC? Does it make you feel uneasy that a Chinese company serves as a legitimate threat to our beloved Amazon, Ebay, and PayPal?",

With just days away from its Initial Public Offering (IPO), Alibaba is slated to draw in $24.3bn, according to the Wall St. Journal.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who aren’t so finance savvy, an IPO is essentially taking a private company public. The company, in this case Alibaba, hires an investment bank, which seeks investors to buy shares, or ownership, of the company. The investment bankers are responsible for pricing the shares and use a variety of methods to come up with that price. The shares are then issued to the public and traded on the secondary market (this is what we call the stock market).\r\nSo what does Alibaba actually do? Well, they are a Chinese e-commerce company with a twist. You can literally buy anything under the sun, from fresh fruit to electric tools to automobiles. The service is B2B (business to business) transactions, as most of the products are sold in bulk. If that’s the Amazon part, then the eBay element is that there are literally thousands upon thousands of suppliers from all over the world and you can negotiate the price on goods if you buy enough items.\r\n\r\nThe element that most resembles PayPal is Alipay. This is possibly the most telling of exactly how large Alibaba is. Average daily transaction volume of Alipay is $298mm, that’s every day of the year people! In comparison, PayPal has a daily transaction volume of $397mm, so it looks like Alibaba still has some ways to grow before it can catch this giant.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is set to IPO on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “BABA” and as of September 5th, 2014 share price is expected to be $60-$66. Personally, I think it’s great to have some more competition in the tech space because more competition always means better prices and more differentiated service for the customer.\r\n\r\nWould you buy in? I have to say I’m bullish on Alibaba, due primarily to their 43% operating margin. In comparison, Amazon’s operating margin is 0%. How do you feel about this Chinese company IPO-ing in NYC? Does it make you feel uneasy that a Chinese company serves as a legitimate threat to our beloved Amazon, Ebay, and PayPal?",

The resource that heats homes and fuels cars fluctuates with global supply\/demand, government regulation, and the condition of many major drilling corporations. Although oil recently dipped to a two week low to $53 a barrel, it is still near a yearly high.

Specifically, Iraq and Venezuela are failing to comply with new regulation.\r\n\r\nSimply put, prices are high because available oil to buy has decreased. In comparison, the stocks of many oil drilling companies have risen to keep up with a high demand.

    "post_content": "<h5>Katherine Virgino<\/h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, technology giants Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) and longstanding partner, BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY) agreed to a binding arbitration to settle a yearlong dispute in regard to a pre-arranged cap concerning licensing payments, which ultimately awarded BlackBerry $815 million.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Blackberry.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-335 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Blackberry-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Android Authority<\/p>\r\nQualcomm, self-described as a ‘world leader in 3G and next-generation mobile technologies,’ is an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications company, and licenses patents necessary for mobile communication, thus collecting royalties on nearly every smartphone in the market. The company charges its licensing fees based on a percentage up to 5% of the average selling price of a device, but its agreement with BlackBerry prior to the arbitration decision included a cap on such fees. After recently reporting a second-quarter profit of $749 million on total sales of $5.02 billion, this arbitration decision cut greatly into Qualcomm’s top line, decreasing revenue in its patent licensing segment by 40% to $1.33 billion.\r\n\r\nAlthough this particular case has had no impact on Qualcomm’s licensing agreements with other partners and notable clients, the company has faced a very recent $1 billion lawsuit with Cupertino-based giant, Apple, concerning similar ‘inordinately high’ prices for its technologies. Likewise, Qualcomm has also faced legal action from the Federal Trade Commission in addition to South Korea and China’s regulatory authorities regarding anti-competitive practices. As this chipmaker is under attack, how much can it continue to profit from its seemingly monopolistic intellectual property?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what does this mean for BlackBerry? After reporting unusually large adjusted earnings in its last quarter, the company has begun an expansion of its licensing strategy into other technology components – including wearables, tablets, appliances, medical devices, and possibly automobile software. Immediately after its $815 million arbitration agreement, BBRY stocks shot up 16%, as BlackBerry stockholders are aware of the additional cushion to its balance sheet. Although the company has been lagging behind competitors such as Apple and Samsung for quite some time, BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen has since stated that he expects BlackBerry’s software business to continue to grow 13% to 15% in the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThis legal dispute between BlackBerry and Qualcomm Inc. bring into light anti-competitive practices that continue to exist past the Rockefeller Age and into the ‘Age of the Smartphone.’ With several regulatory authorities recognizing Qualcomm’s control of the mobile technology realm, Qualcomm’s mobile technology competitors – including Huahei, HTC, Nokia, and Samsung – have more leverage now than ever to rise, improve product potential, and maximize revenue.\r\n\r\n<em>Sources<\/em>:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Brugger, T.

    "post_content": "by Chandrapaul Latchman\r\n\r\nSeptember 7, 2014\r\n\r\nEbay meets Amazon meets PayPal. That’s what pundits are calling China’s hottest technology company, Alibaba. With just days away from its Initial Public Offering (IPO), Alibaba is slated to draw in $24.3bn, according to the Wall St. Journal.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who aren’t so finance savvy, an IPO is essentially taking a private company public. The company, in this case Alibaba, hires an investment bank, which seeks investors to buy shares, or ownership, of the company. The investment bankers are responsible for pricing the shares and use a variety of methods to come up with that price. The shares are then issued to the public and traded on the secondary market (this is what we call the stock market).\r\nSo what does Alibaba actually do? Well, they are a Chinese e-commerce company with a twist. You can literally buy anything under the sun, from fresh fruit to electric tools to automobiles. The service is B2B (business to business) transactions, as most of the products are sold in bulk. If that’s the Amazon part, then the eBay element is that there are literally thousands upon thousands of suppliers from all over the world and you can negotiate the price on goods if you buy enough items.\r\n\r\nThe element that most resembles PayPal is Alipay. This is possibly the most telling of exactly how large Alibaba is. Average daily transaction volume of Alipay is $298mm, that’s every day of the year people! In comparison, PayPal has a daily transaction volume of $397mm, so it looks like Alibaba still has some ways to grow before it can catch this giant.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is set to IPO on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “BABA” and as of September 5th, 2014 share price is expected to be $60-$66. Personally, I think it’s great to have some more competition in the tech space because more competition always means better prices and more differentiated service for the customer.\r\n\r\nWould you buy in? I have to say I’m bullish on Alibaba, due primarily to their 43% operating margin. In comparison, Amazon’s operating margin is 0%. How do you feel about this Chinese company IPO-ing in NYC? Does it make you feel uneasy that a Chinese company serves as a legitimate threat to our beloved Amazon, Ebay, and PayPal?",

Unemployment rate is high, businesses aren’t doing too well, and money is simply not circulating enough. To ameliorate current disaster, European Union (E.U) is experimenting with various methods.

The obvious goal is to boost the economy and here’s how that goes. First, low interest rates encourage businesses to borrow more money at ease, trying out more ideas at a lower risk. When some of those businesses flourish, that will aid money circulation while providing more work for the unemployed. Secondly, lower interest rates reduce the value of their currency (Euros), and you might wonder, “How is lowering your currency going to help your economy?” And the answer is, lower interest rates allows European traders to export more because for the foreign traders, Euro is more affordable. Therefore, the fundamental idea of this approach is correct when viewed from macroeconomic theories.\r\n\r\nWhat’s interesting to me is that U.S has done this for the past decade, and European Union has joined in this move to ‘delete’ interest rates.

As of this past Friday, the future appears bright as far numbers are concerned; what began as an opening price of $68 a share soared nearly 40% to $93.89 per share. This impressive increase in price seems to validate the high value attributed to Alibaba these past few weeks. The company, commonly referred to as having a “higher market value than Ebay and Amazon combined,” seems to have lived up to widespread expectations. Yet, after all of this ostensible success, one must wonder: what exactly does the future of this massive online marketplace hold? And why are so many still reluctant to invest in what seems to be a surefire way to profit from a rapidly expanding company?\r\n\r\nNow that Alibaba is officially registered on the NYSE, the rapidly expanding Chinese company plans on using the capital raised to continue investing in established companies as well as start-ups. Although most commonly referred to as “the e-commerce giant”, Alibaba has placed large sums of money into companies such as Lyft, a major player in the transportation market, and Quixey, the online search engine for apps. In addition, Alibaba founder Jack Ma proposed an expansion of the e-commerce company into growing markets around the world in attempt to perpetuate its rising value. If all of these goals point to a future of success and continued economic prosperity, then our earlier question regarding the hesitancy for some to invest in Alibaba is all the more perplexing.\r\n\r\nDespite what appears to be a safe investment with a high return, there are many legitimate concerns regarding Alibaba. Firstly, one must wonder what is inherently proprietary about the company. More practically, what is preventing a group in China, or even America, from mimicking the techniques used by Alibaba? Surely the established customer relationship they have can quickly shift if some group can offer the same services in a more efficient manner. Secondly, in a world where technological innovations are constant, what promise is there that Alibaba can maintain its online appeal? Who’s to say the Chinese company can adapt to the technological advances that will undoubtedly arise in the future? Lastly, many potential investors view the handful of companies Alibaba has invested in as a negative sign- what is the significance of putting money into what seems to be a random grab-bag of corporations? Moreover, what relevance do these various companies have with regard to the services Alibaba offers?\r\n\r\nEvidently, both sides to the “Alibaba dilemma” exist. What began as a profitable first day of trading may or may not continue in the future. Perhaps the cluster of companies Alibaba holds shares in may grow, but perhaps not.

    "post_content": "By: Mahum Khan\r\n\r\nSeptember 16, 2014\r\n\r\nSantander, Spain’s largest bank by market value, has chosen Ana Botin as its chairwoman after the death of the bank’s longtime head Emilio Botin. Ana Botin is the daughter of Emilio Botin and was in charge of the U.K. operations of the bank. The move represents a continuation of the Botin line as head of the bank since the early 20th century. Ana Botin is regarded as a capable successor and is credited with turning around the U.K. operations of Santander.\r\n\r\nSantander has grown rapidly and transformed itself from a regional lender to one of the biggest banks in Spain through savvy deal making, cost cutting and an aggressive marketing campaign. Emilio Botin, in particular, was credited with having a global vision by expanding the bank globally and reducing its reliance on Spain as a source of profits. With the acquisitions of ABN Amro, Sovereign and others, Santander was able to diversify its risks and suffered less than its peers from Spain’s financial downturn and continuing problems. It remains to be seen whether Ana Botin can bring the same kind of vision to her role that her father did.\r\n\r\nMany financial institutions are synonymous with the names of their chief executives and Santander was no exception. Emilio was a legendary banker who took over the reins of the bank from his father and remained at the head for the greater part of half a century. However, it is important to note that he was not as involved in the day-to-day operations of the bank’s many units and allowed his managers to execute strategies as they saw fit.

    "post_content": "By: Mahum Khan\r\n\r\nSeptember 16, 2014\r\n\r\nSantander, Spain’s largest bank by market value, has chosen Ana Botin as its chairwoman after the death of the bank’s longtime head Emilio Botin. Ana Botin is the daughter of Emilio Botin and was in charge of the U.K. operations of the bank. The move represents a continuation of the Botin line as head of the bank since the early 20th century. Ana Botin is regarded as a capable successor and is credited with turning around the U.K. operations of Santander.\r\n\r\nSantander has grown rapidly and transformed itself from a regional lender to one of the biggest banks in Spain through savvy deal making, cost cutting and an aggressive marketing campaign. Emilio Botin, in particular, was credited with having a global vision by expanding the bank globally and reducing its reliance on Spain as a source of profits. With the acquisitions of ABN Amro, Sovereign and others, Santander was able to diversify its risks and suffered less than its peers from Spain’s financial downturn and continuing problems. It remains to be seen whether Ana Botin can bring the same kind of vision to her role that her father did.\r\n\r\nMany financial institutions are synonymous with the names of their chief executives and Santander was no exception. Emilio was a legendary banker who took over the reins of the bank from his father and remained at the head for the greater part of half a century. However, it is important to note that he was not as involved in the day-to-day operations of the bank’s many units and allowed his managers to execute strategies as they saw fit. This should allay fears that his death will prove to be detrimental to the bank. Over the years, Emilio nurtured and positioned capable executives at the head of the bank’s many units and allowed them the opportunity to govern without too much meddling. This has resulted in Santander having a strong and deep bench of executives that can aid Ana Botina as she acclimatizes herself at the head of the bank.",

The committee was created in response to claims that the Fed can only resolve issues after they have occurred instead of being able to identify and curbing hazardous financial situations.

The Financial Services Act of 2012 backs the U.K. committee by law and incorporates financial stability mandates into the central bank’s mission. Conversely, under current U.S. Law, regulators have been told to merely watch over the safety of banks and protect investors. Fischer has suggested that congress should make an explicit mandate regarding financial stability for all U.S. financial regulators, much like what their counterparts in Parliament have done.\r\n\r\nThe financial stability committee may be a way for the Fed to delegate responsibilities. However, it may just add on to the long list of committees that the Fed already possesses only creating dialogue without much, if any, action. This is partly due to the nature of committees in the Fed. One might also question as to why the Federal Reserve, and not the Securities and Exchange Commission created such a committee. It is understandable that the Fed wants to prevent another crisis, nonetheless is it worth creating a committee that possibly may not have any implementation power?

In an ideal world, you would walk outside, yawn, and a coffee vendor would appear from around the corner. Creepy, right? Big data means big contracts for companies that want to put up data collectors on public property. Cities and municipalities are gaining a growing amount of revenue from companies like Cisco, IBM, and Microsoft that are eager to put up sensors to track people traffic and noise.

Many of these advances can lead to better governance of cities and can affect items such as property values (ie apartment selling for more because it’s in a quieter part of town) and public safety.\r\n\r\nBig data has largely been successful for the technology companies previously mentioned because they tend to track your purchases and online behaviors, and bombard us with ads of things that we probably don’t need but end up buying anyways because… well, why not? Okay, now this might not be you, but that’s how Silicon Valley thinks. If they can get in your head and come up with a “profile” for you, then they can milk— er better serve you.\r\n\r\nBut what happens when Big Data is used for the public good?

Big Data can help us with pollution in big cities and help us identify areas that need the most police officers on guard at night.\r\n\r\nA somewhat unnerving thought is that people could know what time you go to bed as well. A scientist in Brooklyn is doing just that by taking a look across the East River with an infrared camera that can detect light activity in some 800 rooms in Manhattan.

    "post_content": "By: Jaehan Jeong\r\n\r\nSeptember 7, 2014\r\n\r\nEveryone should have heard about the slumping European economy for the past few years. Unemployment rate is high, businesses aren’t doing too well, and money is simply not circulating enough. To ameliorate current disaster, European Union (E.U) is experimenting with various methods. Past Thursday September 4th, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank (ECB)’s president announced their new approach to revitalizing the helpless European economy: cutting down interest rates to near zero.\r\n\r\nOne might think, “cutting down interest rates” sounds somewhat familiar. And yes, it should sound familiar because that’s what U.S government has been doing for quite some time. Even though cutting down interest rates may seem trivial, it’s a huge deal in macro-economics. The obvious goal is to boost the economy and here’s how that goes. First, low interest rates encourage businesses to borrow more money at ease, trying out more ideas at a lower risk. When some of those businesses flourish, that will aid money circulation while providing more work for the unemployed. Secondly, lower interest rates reduce the value of their currency (Euros), and you might wonder, “How is lowering your currency going to help your economy?” And the answer is, lower interest rates allows European traders to export more because for the foreign traders, Euro is more affordable. Therefore, the fundamental idea of this approach is correct when viewed from macroeconomic theories.\r\n\r\nWhat’s interesting to me is that U.S has done this for the past decade, and European Union has joined in this move to ‘delete’ interest rates. What would happen if all countries tried to lower their currency? Who would be most profitable? Some food for thought.",

    "post_content": "By Josh Solomowitz\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\nMinecraft, one of the world’s most popular games, is now owned by Microsoft. The Swedish developer, Mojang, is being purchased by the giant for about $2.5 billion this coming Monday, September 15th. With 100 million players, Mojang is the best paid app with Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android system. Minecraft, which started five years ago as a PC game, now has about 54 million sales, 40% of which are played on mobile devices.\n\nThis acquisition may not seem like a big deal, but in the technology sector, it is significant. These large deals don’t come around too often. Microsoft paid eight times Mojang’s sales last year. A deal of similar magnitude occurred last year when Japan’s SoftBank paid 3.5 times projected annual sales of Supercell, a Finnish game maker. Electronic Arts actually paid 11 times the sales of PopCap only three years ago, at a $750 million price tag!\n\nMicrosoft only holds 2.5% of the smartphone market, which could mean that they are desperate for more consumers. The acquisition may sway millions of users to now buy Microsoft phones, which could add more benefits to Microsoft smartphone owners.\n\nJoost van Dreunen, Chief Executive of research firm SuperData, said he doubts that the addition of Minecraft will have any lasting effects of Microsoft’s share in the smartphone market.\n\nWas Minecraft worth the $2.5 billion cost? I think it was a good move on their part. Considering that they have $86 billion in cash and short-term investments, Microsoft has some cash to play around with. With Microsoft’s move comes assumptions and high hopes – the loyal fans of Minecraft may just play into their hands — and phones.",

However, these predominantly male companies have been criticized for its lack of gender diversity. So as an attempt to recruit more female employees, Silicon Valley companies are taking action. Facebook and Apple are financing egg freezing for their female employees.\r\n\r\nEgg freezing is a practice mainly for women who want or need to delay childbearing in order to pursue educational, career, or other personal goals. This practice is also common among women who are diagnosed with cancer. Hence, this new perk is a very attractive and appealing to highly ambitious women in the technology field.\r\n\r\nEgg freezing is an expensive procedure, costing up to $20,000 with about two rounds of egg retrieval. Why are these high tech Silicon Valley companies putting so much effort into financing this expensive procedure? They want their female workers to stay, and work for as long as possible. Companies are aware that childbearing is one of the most prevalent factors that women contemplate before accepting a job offer. Now this solves their issue. So why not take the opportunity?\r\n\r\nThis approach comes with both pros and cons. This benefit is also available to employees’ spouses. This can also help talented women balance their workforce and life. However, this brings to light a question: is delaying child labor really necessary? Enabling female employees to delay having children can be seen as temporarily beneficial. But in the long run, these high tech companies need to address the right benefits to workers who are having children. So instead of avoiding these situations for the short-term, they should instead address what is most appropriate and right for the long term. These long-term resolutions should include caregiving, flexibility, and direct supports that secure a spot in their workplace but at the same time help women combine work and life.\r\n\r\nSo the egg freezing procedure only addresses a small part of a bigger problem. Both Facebook and Apple paid parental leave policies and on-site health care. Facebook also subsidizes daycare costs for their employees. Facebook told NPR that it is offering this benefit because “employees were asking for it.” But for companies, when their employees present them with a choice, they need to be extra careful not to send off a wrong message. For example, expanding benefits to finance egg-freezing could come off as a method for these high tech companies to put pressure on women to delay childbearing so that their employer can get more hours out of them.\r\n\r\nAll in all, egg freezing gives women more choices and control over their lives and pursuing of their aspirations. Whether or not this is working, we can see that the high tech companies are actively working to recruit more women. They are responding to what young and talented women in the field want. For many women in the field, having children can be a big burden or privilege as they make career decisions. So do babies and high tech advancements not go together hand in hand?",

Apple and these five major publishers were accused of raising the average price of a newly released e-book from Amazon’s set price of $9.99.\r\n\r\nThe Justice Department initiated the suit in 2012, focusing on the fact that Apple entered the digital books industry in 2010 when publishers still followed the “wholesale model” of print books.

    "post_content": "By: Joungmin Park\r\n\r\nNovember 24, 2014\r\n\r\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited, commonly called Alibaba, made a big hit in the United States when it first announced its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange just two months ago. In September 2014, it established itself as the largest technology listing in United States history, exceeding that of Facebook.\r\n\r\nSo what is Alibaba? It is a Chinese e-commerce company that provides consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer, and business-to-business sales services via web portals. In addition, it also provides electronic payment services, a shopping search engine and data-centric cloud computing services. The group was founded in 1999 by Jack Ma with the start of the website Alibaba.com. Now, Alibaba tops 5 fast-growing Chinese Internet Stocks, and has been a hugely profitable company. As of November 5, 2014, the company’s revenue rose 54 percent to $2.7 billion.\r\n\r\nThe group is also known for its generosity as well. In September 18, 2014, Alibaba has handed out stock to all levels of workers, creating a wealth diaspora rarely seen in China. Now, Alibaba finally sold $8 billion of bonds in company’s debut sale with maturities spanning from three to 20 years.\r\n\r\nAlibaba seeks capital to expand to the West by creating a new digital “silk road” for intercontinental online trade. What makes this company so successful in generating billions of dollars in profits? Alibaba’s business model lies in business-to-business sales. This gives them a high efficiency in reducing costs and a quality control certification process that has curtailed apprehension among skeptical online shoppers.\r\n\r\nSo now as the top new position for hedge funds, Alibaba is the 16th largest holding of the aggregate portfolio, as 21 of the 50 largest hedge funds had a position in the company. Now, what are the implications of their actions? Alibaba put itself where Americans may not: The United States bond market. Chinese business is entering the United States market, and even topping Americans. This could potentially be the next biggest trend in American bond market, as demand for high-quality investments outruns supply.\r\n\r\nSince its successful IPO in late September, the demand for the deal is extraordinary., Alibaba may even be forced to expand its offering size a bit to accommodate orders for well over $50 billion in bonds. Some stock investors see this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

    "post_content": "By: Joungmin Park\r\n\r\nNovember 24, 2014\r\n\r\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited, commonly called Alibaba, made a big hit in the United States when it first announced its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange just two months ago. In September 2014, it established itself as the largest technology listing in United States history, exceeding that of Facebook.\r\n\r\nSo what is Alibaba? It is a Chinese e-commerce company that provides consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer, and business-to-business sales services via web portals. In addition, it also provides electronic payment services, a shopping search engine and data-centric cloud computing services. The group was founded in 1999 by Jack Ma with the start of the website Alibaba.com. Now, Alibaba tops 5 fast-growing Chinese Internet Stocks, and has been a hugely profitable company. As of November 5, 2014, the company’s revenue rose 54 percent to $2.7 billion.\r\n\r\nThe group is also known for its generosity as well. In September 18, 2014, Alibaba has handed out stock to all levels of workers, creating a wealth diaspora rarely seen in China. Now, Alibaba finally sold $8 billion of bonds in company’s debut sale with maturities spanning from three to 20 years.\r\n\r\nAlibaba seeks capital to expand to the West by creating a new digital “silk road” for intercontinental online trade. What makes this company so successful in generating billions of dollars in profits? Alibaba’s business model lies in business-to-business sales. This gives them a high efficiency in reducing costs and a quality control certification process that has curtailed apprehension among skeptical online shoppers.\r\n\r\nSo now as the top new position for hedge funds, Alibaba is the 16th largest holding of the aggregate portfolio, as 21 of the 50 largest hedge funds had a position in the company. Now, what are the implications of their actions? Alibaba put itself where Americans may not: The United States bond market. Chinese business is entering the United States market, and even topping Americans. This could potentially be the next biggest trend in American bond market, as demand for high-quality investments outruns supply.\r\n\r\nSince its successful IPO in late September, the demand for the deal is extraordinary., Alibaba may even be forced to expand its offering size a bit to accommodate orders for well over $50 billion in bonds. Some stock investors see this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. On the other hand, bond investors are far more concerned with the stability of Alibaba’s future cash flows.\r\n\r\nSo while the media is hiking up the popularity and value of Alibaba, in the long run, it is unclear how Alibaba would maintain or even outgrow their current value. It holds quite an uncertain future, and whether or not they would be stable and secure enough. There are risks that follow this argument. First, Alibaba’s history as a public company is quite short. There are also questions about how Alibaba can grow and expand its business scope both domestically and outside China.\r\n\r\nAnother explanation for why investors were all competing to buy Alibaba bonds is due to scarcity. There simply aren’t a lot of new bonds up for sale in the American market. Numerous American companies issued bonds in euros rather than dollars to take advantage of lower rates there.\r\n\r\nOverall, what does this mean for American investors? We do not have a concrete answer, but we do know that Alibaba is a Cayman shell company. A large, high profile company like this one is likely to hold itself to a higher standard. Also, what other issues are on the rise if more Chinese companies invade the American bond markets?

This company crowd sourced $6.85 million as an investment that will be used to hire employees and ship to hundreds of retailers. Upfront Ventures and RPM Ventures were the leaders behind the huge investment.

Deliv is already operating in four GGP malls, but plans to be nationwide by the holidays. “Once we sign a retailer all we need to do is add zip codes to our database and we have same day delivery demand in a city,” explained the founder and CEO of Deliv, Daphne Carmelli.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of Deliv is to connect the customer, retailer, and courier in an efficient way for the customers to transact with retailers with cost efficiency.

The slowing growth rate, while not a major concern right now, has prompted some serious questions about the future prospects of China, which needs its GDP to grow by at least 7.2% to create an additional 10 million jobs every year for its expanding population. GDP growth declined from 7.5% in the second quarter of 2014 with property values remaining stagnant or declining and the property sector (which accounts for nearly a fourth of GDP) being a drag on overall growth. The slowing growth rate has motivated the Chinese government to roll out several fiscal and monetary easing measures including stepped-up spending on railways, energy, public housing, expanded credit to farmers and private businesses and more relaxed rules for the housing sector. In the latest move, China’s central bank told financial executives late last week that it planned to inject 200 billion Yuan ($32.6 billion) into the banking system in hopes of pushing the economy into a higher growth trajectory.

This is yet another attempt by Nintendo to recover from their revenue loss, which began back in January 2014, when the company experienced dismal sales on their Wii U consoles. Amiibo figurines “interact with supported video game software, allowing data to be transferred in and out of each game and across multiple platforms.” The characters also give access to special items and bonus points throughout the game. These action figures include all of Nintendo’s classic characters, including Mario and Luigi.\r\n\r\nBy reaching into the Nintendo character vault, the company hopes to reclaim its strong footing in the video game industry. At the moment, Nintendo’s competitors, Microsoft’s XBox and Sony’s Playstation have asserted their dominance in the industry as Nintendo operated at a loss for the first, second, and third quarters this year. In the first week of September 2014, XBox sold 124,736 consoles; Playstation sold 133,226; and Wii U sold a mere 40,562.\r\n\r\nAmid Nintendo’s struggle to maintain its recent return to profit, the video game corporation is utilizing its greatest asset: intellectual property, which includes the classic characters such as the Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong. Although the incorporation of these familiar characters will give Nintendo an edge over its competitors, it is difficult to see the success of this venture. The Amiibo figurines are only compatible with Wii U consoles, which have failed to occupy a majority market share among game consoles.

Nonetheless, the nations do not seem to be in agreement with Ecuador and Venezuela to make these cuts, while Kuwait is adamantly against them. The way the current market is set up, if one nation begins to reduce production, another will notice and begin to increase production in order to capitalize the on greater market share. This may be a critical point of debate at the upcoming meeting.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, the United States is on its way to becoming one of the largest producers of oil in the world. But what does this all mean for the average American? It certainly means more economic activity is likely, just in time for the retail’s busiest season of the year. The extra $100-150 that will be saved may be the difference between a middle class family going out on a Friday night or staying at home. The November 27th meeting will be a critical indicator of whether oil prices will stabilize or continue to plunge.",

The OPEC nations are set to meet on November 27th to discuss the possibility of a coordinated reduction in supply if they feel it is necessary. Nonetheless, the nations do not seem to be in agreement with Ecuador and Venezuela to make these cuts, while Kuwait is adamantly against them. The way the current market is set up, if one nation begins to reduce production, another will notice and begin to increase production in order to capitalize the on greater market share. This may be a critical point of debate at the upcoming meeting.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, the United States is on its way to becoming one of the largest producers of oil in the world. But what does this all mean for the average American? It certainly means more economic activity is likely, just in time for the retail’s busiest season of the year. The extra $100-150 that will be saved may be the difference between a middle class family going out on a Friday night or staying at home. The November 27th meeting will be a critical indicator of whether oil prices will stabilize or continue to plunge.",

More than 30 million cars in the United States have been recalled due to faulty airbags that can explode and injure or kill passengers.

This is creating a huge impact in Takata’s business, as airbags are 40% of their sales. Its stock price have dropped 45% and they are facing more than $200 million worth of fines. Government investigators found Takata had misled regulators since 2009 about the safety of air bag inflators.

    "post_content": "Chynelle Menezes\r\n\r\nNovember 24, 2015\r\n\r\nThe global stock markets seem to be remarkably resilient. In the wake of the Paris attacks, stock market prices were expected to decline as they did directly after the 9\/11 terrorist attacks, the 2005 London attacks, and the Madrid train bombings in March. Instead the French and European markets rose about 3%[1]. The only French industries adversely affected by the devastating attacks that took place the night of November 13th, 2015 were travel\/tourism and luxury. France has the largest number of tourists in the world and the travel\/tourism sector accounts for 7.5% of its GDP[2]. Its largest hotel group, Accor Hotels, experienced a 7% decline but ended the day around 5% down. France is second worldwide in luxury goods spending, after New York. Stocks of companies like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton took hits after the Paris attacks as well. [3]\r\n\r\nThe United States markets were largely unaffected by the Paris attacks. News of the attacks had only begun to trickle in as the day was closing and did not affect US shareholder spending. Oil prices, which are normally sensitive to geopolitical risk, were barely moved by the attacks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 91.06 points, breaking even for the year. S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq were up 1.5% and 7.8%, respectively.[4]\r\n\r\nHowever, the Paris attacks may affect borrowing rates in the future. After 9\/11, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term borrowing rates by 0.5% and continued to cut rates over the next year. After the 2005 London terrorist bombings, the Bank of England also cut short-term rates. Economists expect the European Central Bank to follow suit. Currently France’s GDP is flat and rate changes might indirectly boost not only France’s economy, but the economy of Europe as a whole.[5] The Wall Street Journal says the attacks have raised concerns with the structure of the European Union, especially security and immigration regulations, which may later affect the markets. While it is still likely for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates in December, it may re-examine this course in the wake of the attacks and their effects on American foreign policy and their subsequent effect on the market.[6]\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[1] \"The Real Reason Stocks Are Up After the Paris Terror Attacks.\" Time.

Currently France’s GDP is flat and rate changes might indirectly boost not only France’s economy, but the economy of Europe as a whole.[5] The Wall Street Journal says the attacks have raised concerns with the structure of the European Union, especially security and immigration regulations, which may later affect the markets. While it is still likely for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates in December, it may re-examine this course in the wake of the attacks and their effects on American foreign policy and their subsequent effect on the market.[6]\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[1] \"The Real Reason Stocks Are Up After the Paris Terror Attacks.\" Time.

Major causes include the abundance of oil in the market that are oversupplied by the U.S. and other exporting countries unwilling to limit production, as well as the reduced demand of a more environmentally-conscious global population. The current price of oil is just above $40 per barrel, a low paralleled only by the price when the stock market crashed in 2009. Although easier on independent consumers and countries that depend on imported oil (chiefly European and Asian nations), the lower prices on gas generally result in an enormous capital loss for oil production companies and their respective countries’ economies.\r\n\r\nThe central cause of the unstable oil prices across the globe is OPEC’s (13-nation oil cartel) unwillingness to reduce production to stabilize the markets. Venezuela, Iran, and Algeria, all of which are OPEC members, have unsuccessfully been disputing with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and other gulf nations as to whether or not to intervene in the oversupplied market and collectively cut down production.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia, with greater resources, such as foreign currency reserves and clout in OPEC, has a similar policy to that of Russia. Russia, a large oil producer and exporter, loses approximately 2 billion U.S. dollars for every dollar drop per barrel, and economists predict its economy will shrink by 0.7% if prices do not recover. Yet, it will not lower production amounts because it cannot risk losing market shares and competitors taking the opportunity to raise their own production outputs. With oil producers around the world either increasing output, refusing to lower output, or lowering output too slowly, prices will continue to spiral downwards.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a rare type of occurrence that affects oil prices is terrorist attacks. After the Al-Qaeda attacks in New York City on 9\/11, transportation-related expenses, on average, went down and resulted in a reduced demand for oil. A similar situation may also arise from the recent devastating attack on Paris by ISIS.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Bowler, Tim. \"Falling Oil Prices: Who Are the Winners and Losers? - BBC News.\" BBC News.

    "post_content": "Chris Angelidis\r\n\r\nDecember 5, 2015\r\n\r\nEach day, thousands of Syrians flee their homes due to continuous violence and conflict. Since 2011, Syria has been torn in civil war. Complicating matters further, foreign groups and countries with vested interests in the outcome of the war have gotten involved as well. In total, the powers in the war include the Syrian government, Syrian rebels, ISIS, Hezbollah, Kurdish freedom fighters, France, America, and Russia. Within a single country, a war for democracy, freedom, religion, and influence rages. Civilians are literally caught in the middle of this as the majority of fighting occurs within the densely populated cities. Government forces systematically cut off food, water, and power supplies to the cities to discourage rebels. Moreover, many of the factions are known to systematically kidnap, torture, rape, and murder citizens as a means of extracting information and oppressing the masses. Since the beginning of the war, approximately 30,000 civilians have died in the crossfire.\r\n\r\nMigrants fleeing from these appalling conditions typically head for Turkey. Once across the border, they zigzag through the country to avoid detection. They primarily travel towards Ankara, to Istanbul, to the Mediterranean coast, where they pay smugglers approximately 800 euros to take them to any one of the Greek, Dodecanese islands. From there, they head towards Athens to travel by air to larger European countries or the Americas. Those who lack the connections or the resources to obtain or counterfeit ID’s, must travel by foot, bus, and car across Europe. For the majority of these refugees, the ultimate goal is the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, France, and the U.K.\r\n\r\nMigrant rates across Europe as a whole have increased by as much as 750%. This drastic change has overwhelmed small economies such as Greece and Italy from where migrants typically enter Europe. As many as 300,000—over 4 times the native population—can enter an island over the course of a month. These islands lack the necessary housing, electricity, food, and water, to care for the migrants. Moreover, refugees are typically ill received on these islands as their presence hurts the local tourism industry and strains their already limited infrastructure. Clearly these victims cannot be sent back to the wasteland they once called home, and, as such, a more formalized process of migration must be created in order to facilitate this journey while at the same time protecting locals from possible repercussions.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Anna Triandafyllidou and Thanos Maroukis.

    "post_content": "Chris Angelidis\r\n\r\nDecember 5, 2015\r\n\r\nEach day, thousands of Syrians flee their homes due to continuous violence and conflict. Since 2011, Syria has been torn in civil war. Complicating matters further, foreign groups and countries with vested interests in the outcome of the war have gotten involved as well. In total, the powers in the war include the Syrian government, Syrian rebels, ISIS, Hezbollah, Kurdish freedom fighters, France, America, and Russia. Within a single country, a war for democracy, freedom, religion, and influence rages. Civilians are literally caught in the middle of this as the majority of fighting occurs within the densely populated cities. Government forces systematically cut off food, water, and power supplies to the cities to discourage rebels. Moreover, many of the factions are known to systematically kidnap, torture, rape, and murder citizens as a means of extracting information and oppressing the masses. Since the beginning of the war, approximately 30,000 civilians have died in the crossfire.\r\n\r\nMigrants fleeing from these appalling conditions typically head for Turkey. Once across the border, they zigzag through the country to avoid detection. They primarily travel towards Ankara, to Istanbul, to the Mediterranean coast, where they pay smugglers approximately 800 euros to take them to any one of the Greek, Dodecanese islands. From there, they head towards Athens to travel by air to larger European countries or the Americas. Those who lack the connections or the resources to obtain or counterfeit ID’s, must travel by foot, bus, and car across Europe. For the majority of these refugees, the ultimate goal is the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, France, and the U.K.\r\n\r\nMigrant rates across Europe as a whole have increased by as much as 750%. This drastic change has overwhelmed small economies such as Greece and Italy from where migrants typically enter Europe. As many as 300,000—over 4 times the native population—can enter an island over the course of a month. These islands lack the necessary housing, electricity, food, and water, to care for the migrants. Moreover, refugees are typically ill received on these islands as their presence hurts the local tourism industry and strains their already limited infrastructure. Clearly these victims cannot be sent back to the wasteland they once called home, and, as such, a more formalized process of migration must be created in order to facilitate this journey while at the same time protecting locals from possible repercussions.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Anna Triandafyllidou and Thanos Maroukis.

We are often bombarded with many advertisements that surround the webpage we are viewing, whether it be watching a YouTube video or reading a news article.

Other companies such as Apple and Google have developed alternative strategies to combat the age of ad-blocking software.

    "post_content": "By: Phil Chen\r\n\r\nJanuary 25, 2015\r\n\r\nThe state and\/or the health of countries across the globe have come to a seemingly new era of definition of emerging issues with constant implications brought upon the latter and the former. It can be said that the state of the world economy is, to some extent, better than it was during the financial crisis in 2008 seven years ago. Nonetheless, action is still being taken to respond, act and heal not only the flaws and weaknesses of the health of a variety of sovereign, as well as other, nations alike but also in the aspirations, needs and wants of the parts of the global picture in its entirety.\r\n\r\nIn the onset of contemporary outbursts such as the trending decline in oil prices to the central banks of Denmark and Canada cutting rates soon after the Swiss Bank letting the franc trade freely, are some examples of this period of unprecedented uncertainty that affects almost all countries now and in the looming time to come. As for contemporary highlights to take into account, is the situation occurring in Europe.\r\n\r\nFalling oil prices have been the story throughout major countries but deflation especially for Europe. Due to a sense of the effect of plummeting oil prices that are a more of a predicament to the EU than the United States, Mario Draghi and The European Central Bank are taking measures to alleviate deflationary pressures by implementing its quantitative easing program that amounts to at least $1.1 trillion euros against the possibility of a “deflationary spiral” as noted from a relevant article by Jeff Black of Bloomberg LP. Further alarming indications include the fact that the euro has tumbled a month ago to it’s lowest versus the dollar in nearly a decade. Unprecedented times has been answered by unprecedented measures as Europe at this very moment lags behind the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe United States on the other hand has a better picture than Europe but too comes with it’s own flaws. A stronger U.S dollar in addition to the apparent advance in U.S Stocks as noted by the S&amp;P 500 seemingly in response to the ECB Stimulus along with the Dow Jones has proved nothing but positive. The U.S Jobless Claims Report has gone done by close to ten-thousand, the unemployment rate down and a reinvigorating State of the Union Address add on to this positive yet sentimental aggregate. This may, ultimately and presumably, not be the case.\r\n\r\nVarious and disparate interpretations presume that the best or even the worst has yet to come. The future is full of uncertainty. “For me, QE is not an unmitigated positive or negative. It’s going to have a profound impact on all aspects of our business model and we just have to adapt to it and we have been doing that over the last 2 years” says Anshu Jain, Co-Management of the Management Board, Deutsche Bank. Changing times sometimes requires changing tactics. Europe and the world still awaits the outcome and subsequent policies of the elections in Greece to the aspirations of disseminating risk in the EU.\r\n\r\nEven at a comparably better state, the U.S has it’s shortcomings as well. Despite having reached record history low UE rates, wage inflation tells another story.

    "post_content": "By: Phil Chen\r\n\r\nJanuary 25, 2015\r\n\r\nThe state and\/or the health of countries across the globe have come to a seemingly new era of definition of emerging issues with constant implications brought upon the latter and the former. It can be said that the state of the world economy is, to some extent, better than it was during the financial crisis in 2008 seven years ago. Nonetheless, action is still being taken to respond, act and heal not only the flaws and weaknesses of the health of a variety of sovereign, as well as other, nations alike but also in the aspirations, needs and wants of the parts of the global picture in its entirety.\r\n\r\nIn the onset of contemporary outbursts such as the trending decline in oil prices to the central banks of Denmark and Canada cutting rates soon after the Swiss Bank letting the franc trade freely, are some examples of this period of unprecedented uncertainty that affects almost all countries now and in the looming time to come. As for contemporary highlights to take into account, is the situation occurring in Europe.\r\n\r\nFalling oil prices have been the story throughout major countries but deflation especially for Europe. Due to a sense of the effect of plummeting oil prices that are a more of a predicament to the EU than the United States, Mario Draghi and The European Central Bank are taking measures to alleviate deflationary pressures by implementing its quantitative easing program that amounts to at least $1.1 trillion euros against the possibility of a “deflationary spiral” as noted from a relevant article by Jeff Black of Bloomberg LP. Further alarming indications include the fact that the euro has tumbled a month ago to it’s lowest versus the dollar in nearly a decade. Unprecedented times has been answered by unprecedented measures as Europe at this very moment lags behind the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe United States on the other hand has a better picture than Europe but too comes with it’s own flaws. A stronger U.S dollar in addition to the apparent advance in U.S Stocks as noted by the S&amp;P 500 seemingly in response to the ECB Stimulus along with the Dow Jones has proved nothing but positive. The U.S Jobless Claims Report has gone done by close to ten-thousand, the unemployment rate down and a reinvigorating State of the Union Address add on to this positive yet sentimental aggregate. This may, ultimately and presumably, not be the case.\r\n\r\nVarious and disparate interpretations presume that the best or even the worst has yet to come. The future is full of uncertainty. “For me, QE is not an unmitigated positive or negative. It’s going to have a profound impact on all aspects of our business model and we just have to adapt to it and we have been doing that over the last 2 years” says Anshu Jain, Co-Management of the Management Board, Deutsche Bank. Changing times sometimes requires changing tactics. Europe and the world still awaits the outcome and subsequent policies of the elections in Greece to the aspirations of disseminating risk in the EU.\r\n\r\nEven at a comparably better state, the U.S has it’s shortcomings as well. Despite having reached record history low UE rates, wage inflation tells another story. Another version of the unemployment rate, the U-6 has lead several to believe that unemployment is still a few points higher now to that of 2008. The Federal Reserve is hesitant in its intentions to raise interest rates in a superficially growing American economy and many can only assume when that will occur. On and on, the parallels between global and domestic risk only seems to leave unanswered questions where, presumably, time and anticipation may only prove to be the answer.\r\n\r\nFrom the prospects of Davos 2015 to central banks to countries responding across the world, provisional projections are only a piece of the whole pie that is summarized by the paradox between validity and likelihood during changing times and the shifting paradigms in planning for the future. “To some extent the ecb is taking some quite some time in putting this in place and in the meantime deflationary pressures has been building” says the director of Macquarie Private Wealth.

If an agreement is reached, the deal will lead to a significant growth in trade between the two regions, where smaller corporations will gain an opportunity to compete in the global market and consumers will enjoy a cheaper, greater variety of goods. Since tariffs imposed by the two sides are already relatively low, the bigger gains would be obtained through the reduction of non-tariff barriers, particularly from regulatory cooperation. In this context, firms on both sides of the Atlantic will adhere to the same regulatory principles, which would consequently reduce overall trade costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, while a free trade agreement may sound appealing from a theoretical perspective, many related issues have resulted in great controversy and opposition. First, the European Union is concerned that its current food quality standards and consumer protection policies would be weakened if the EU attempts to align its standards with those of the U.S. There is also concern on both sides that the partnership would inevitably result in growing competition, thereby causing workers to lose their jobs to competing foreign sectors. Many have criticized the negotiations for lack of transparency, and even more so for the introduction of the ISDS (Investor-State-Dispute-Settlement), a system that would grant foreign investors the right to sue European states if they believe that EU measures have damaged their investments.\r\n\r\nEvidently, there is much to be gained from the trade agreement but also much to be lost. It is certainly a difficult task to reach a comprehensive plan that would satisfy both sides, but the final implications will be well worth the effort.

Because of this, revenue to the Saudi economy has dropped tremendously.\r\n\r\nDeals are currently in the making for billions of dollars in bond orders: Five year bonds at 2.58%, 10 year notes at 3.4%, and 30 year notes at 4.62%. The new bond issuance is an attempt to revive the once thriving Saudi economy. The country has come to terms with the changing economy and global market and is looking to transform the domestic economy away from oil sales to other, more sustainable sources of income. It is important to monitor the impact of the changing international economic landscape, especially in countries with close ties to the United States.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/saudi-arabia-to-offer-international-investors-17-5-billion-in-bonds-1476876478<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Forecasters have predicted a more substantial amount of economic growth for the United States economy since the 2016 presidential election. While economists expected 2.2% economic growth in 2017 prior to the presidential election, they now expect 2.4% economic growth for the year. Similarly, prior to the election, economic growth for 2018 was expected to be 2.0% in contrast to predictions of 2.5% today.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Huffington-Post-Economic-growth.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-330 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Huffington-Post-Economic-growth-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: HuffingtonPost<\/p>\r\nMany of these improved economic growth predictions stem from the promises that President Trump has made to reduce business regulation, reform a tax code that businesses perceive as oppressive, and put a large infrastructure package into place.  These improved economic growth predictions for the next two years help explain the great performance of stock and bond markets.\r\n\r\nEconomists believe that a positive growth cycle could continue so long as optimism about the economy continues on its current path.\r\n\r\nHowever, economists expect growth to fall back to 2.1% in 2019 and thereafter. This expected rate of growth is similar to that which was expected prior to the 2016 presidential election.  It can be attributed to the different factors that fuel short-term and long-term growth.\r\n\r\nGrowth in infrastructure spending would put many people back to work for the time being, which would strengthen the economy, and an increase in the deficit would provide for more spending, which would strengthen the economy, but these are only temporary fixes. There are alternatives -- actual and substantial tax reform, simplifying regulation that helps companies operate more efficiently -- that would help give economists reason to believe there will be more growth in 2019 and beyond, but they feel uncertain about how much the current erratic presidential administration will actually be able to accomplish, and so they sit and wait to prognosticate as more is revealed.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/wsj-survey-of-economists-sees-growth-climbing-in-2017-and-2018-then-dissipating-1489672873\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/wsj-survey-of-economists-sees-growth-climbing-in-2017-and-2018-then-dissipating-1489672873<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "John Casella\r\n\r\nNovember 15, 2016\r\n\r\nLast Sunday, November 6th, most of North America received a precious extra hour of sleep from Daylight Savings Time (DST). While this time shift might seem like a bonus, according to a JPMorgan Chase Institute report, it could hurt business sales across the country. This finding shows that consumer spending is directly linked to hours of sunlight, and businesses take a bigger hit when people adjust their clocks in the fall as opposed to when they do it in the spring.\r\n\r\nTo support this theory, the JPMorgan Chase Institute gathered 380 million credit card and debit card transactions from 2.5 million Chase customers in two different cities: Los Angeles and Phoenix. The state of Arizona is unique because it does not follow daylight saving time, allowing the Phoenix consumer population to serve as the control group. In the spring, when daylight saving time results in longer hours with sunlight, Los Angeles has a 0.9% increase in daily card spending per capita when compared with Phoenix. However, when people reversed clocks in the fall, having less sunlight lead Los Angeles to a 3.5% decrease in daily card spending per capita in comparison to Phoenix's spending habits. This change was studied by matching the data in a time range from 30 days before DST, to 30 days after.\r\n\r\nDaylight savings time has faced much criticism lately because many people do not experience its benefits, and it is an outdated tradition that the United States perpetuates. However, it is unlikely that the US and Canada will abandon the long-standing practice.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2016\/11\/03\/daylight-saving-time-may-be-bad-for-the-u-s-economy\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "John Casella\r\n\r\nNovember 15, 2016\r\n\r\nLast Sunday, November 6th, most of North America received a precious extra hour of sleep from Daylight Savings Time (DST). While this time shift might seem like a bonus, according to a JPMorgan Chase Institute report, it could hurt business sales across the country. This finding shows that consumer spending is directly linked to hours of sunlight, and businesses take a bigger hit when people adjust their clocks in the fall as opposed to when they do it in the spring.\r\n\r\nTo support this theory, the JPMorgan Chase Institute gathered 380 million credit card and debit card transactions from 2.5 million Chase customers in two different cities: Los Angeles and Phoenix. The state of Arizona is unique because it does not follow daylight saving time, allowing the Phoenix consumer population to serve as the control group. In the spring, when daylight saving time results in longer hours with sunlight, Los Angeles has a 0.9% increase in daily card spending per capita when compared with Phoenix. However, when people reversed clocks in the fall, having less sunlight lead Los Angeles to a 3.5% decrease in daily card spending per capita in comparison to Phoenix's spending habits. This change was studied by matching the data in a time range from 30 days before DST, to 30 days after.\r\n\r\nDaylight savings time has faced much criticism lately because many people do not experience its benefits, and it is an outdated tradition that the United States perpetuates. However, it is unlikely that the US and Canada will abandon the long-standing practice.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2016\/11\/03\/daylight-saving-time-may-be-bad-for-the-u-s-economy\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Kevin Savarese\r\n\r\nNovember 21, 2016\r\n\r\nIn the immediate aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, uncertainty became the focus of global markets. The Mexican Peso became the worst performer in emerging markets this year, and Dow futures were down 300 points at dawn on the morning of Wednesday, November 9th. These performances were the result of an election that left many in shock, and in a state of anticipation. While Donald Trump has made his views on some policies in the course of the election trail abundantly clear, his exact views on Wall Street are more difficult to pinpoint. Investors are unclear as to the extent to which Trump will regulate the banking industry, and how many of his promises are factual. In the remaining two months before the impending Trump presidency, however, it is useful to analyze his statements in order to gain an idea of where the banking industry may be headed.\r\n\r\nWhile more skeptical investors drove the Dow futures market down, many placed faith in banks. The day after the election, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index had already risen 5.15%, and lenders such as JPMorgan Chase had risen to post crisis highs. Investment banks meanwhile, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley soared, and Bank of America and Wells Fargo experienced sharp gains. Much of this immediate success for the banking industry comes as a direct result of Donald Trump’s repeated promise to repeal the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law by the Obama administration in 2010 in response to the financial crisis in the late 2000s. Trump believes the Act to be overreaching and unnecessary, stating that “The banks aren’t loaning money to people that need it… The regulators are running the banks.” With rolled back regulations across the industry, firms will be theoretically freer to release capital or increase lending. While many see this as a necessary step in driving GDP growth, others are more skeptical. In their analysis of possible rollbacks of Dodd-Frank, Moody’s Investors Services states that “While a reduction in regulatory compliance costs would bolster bank earnings, reduced oversight and a roll-back of requirements would also result in a weakening of banks’ capital and liquidity positions, a negative from a credit perspective.” The effects of Trump’s repealing of Dodd-Frank are still the subject of pure speculation, but lessened regulation leads to fears of a repeat of the 2007-2008 financial crisis if banks immediately return to their old ways.\r\n\r\nWhile Trump whole-heartedly advocates the repeal of Dodd-Frank, he has expressed his interest in a modern-day version of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in the investment business. Signing this Act back into law could potentially negate any effect provided by phasing out Dodd-Frank, and would ironically bring back the regulation repealed by Bill Clinton in 1999. In a similar vain to regulating banks, Donald Trump has stated, “I know Wall Street. I know the people on Wall Street… I’m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us.” He also acknowledged that “the hedge fund guys are getting away with murder… They’re paying nothing, and its ridiculous.” While Trump’s campaign would suggest lenient times for banks, his statements suggest otherwise. The frequent recognition of the Wall Street problem shows that Trump may not be willing to sweep it under the carpet, but may not know the exact method to go about doing as such. Donald Trump may be a successful businessman, but his lack of conviction and possible conformance to our new Republican controlled government may mean that none of the regulation he acknowledged as needed will actually happen.\r\n\r\nOnce again, at this point in time a mere outsider can do nothing except speculate as to what the future holds for the banking industry, but perhaps in the meantime it might be best to heed by the advice of Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen who stated this week that she would “certainly not want to see all the improvements that we have put in place, I wouldn’t want to see the clock turned back on those because I do think they are important in diminishing the odds of another financial crisis.”\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/graphics.wsj.com\/elections\/2016\/where-do-clinton-and-trump-stand-on-wall-street\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/11\/14\/donald-trump-gop-inconsistent-on-dodd-frank-banking-regulations-barney-frank.html<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/11\/10\/business\/dealbook\/what-trumps-victory-might-mean-for-banks.html<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-election-trump-banks-idUSKCN12Q2WA<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/antoinegara\/2016\/11\/10\/why-donald-trumps-election-is-the-best-thing-thats-happened-for-banks-in-years\/#637c724e3d86<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2016\/11\/10\/501610842\/trump-team-promises-to-dismantle-dodd-frank-bank-regulations<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-11-08\/mexican-peso-fluctuates-before-make-or-break-presidential-ballot<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/08\/investing\/global-markets-stocks-trump-clinton-us-presidential-election\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

While a large portion of this growth can be attributed to the continued strength in consumer spending, a significant portion can be credited to the shrinking of the U.S. trade deficit. Over the past year, sluggish demand for American goods and a strong U.S. dollar have widened the already large U.S. trade deficit. However, a recent report shows that the trade deficit contracted by 9% in September as a result of a .6% increase in exports and a 1.3% decrease in imports. The rise in exports reflects increased foreign interest in airplanes and industrial engines manufactured in the U.S. Meanwhile, the decline in imports is due to decreased purchase of foreign pharmaceutical products and civilian aircrafts.\r\n\r\nThe reported statistic is a 19-month low for the country’s trade deficit and is an important consideration amid discussions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership with the European Union. In addition, the topic of trade has been a highly contested topic within this year’s presidential debates. The current state of the trade deficit will surely shape the upcoming policy changes of our next elected president.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/u-s-trade-gap-shrunk-9-9-in-september-1478262870<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.deseretnews.com\/article\/765690620\/US-trade-deficit-in-September-at-lowest-level-in-19-months.html?pg=all<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Ranging from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad, Apple has been generating tens of billions of dollars every quarter. But just recently, Apple announced that its revenue for its first fiscal quarter, which ended in March, declined 13% to $50.6 billion. This is the first ever instance in 13 years in which the company has suffered a decline in revenue.\r\n\r\nA possible reason for this decline is that the newest iPhone released by Apple on March 31st, the iPhone SE, popped up in the markets too late to be counted in the quarterly report. Furthermore, with more people becoming Google Android users, Apple’s competition remains as strong as ever. In addition, Apple reached its apex in sales when it introduced the iPhone 6 to the world, a model that was literally a growth in the phone’s model and technological prowess. The iPhone 6S that subsequently released was very similar to the previous model. Wall Street analysts say that it makes sense that Apple had its first decline in revenue, as big tech companies can only bring about so many new products and ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is probably just a temporary “pause,” as Apple CEO, Tim Cook, says. “This, too, shall pass. The future of Apple is very bright.” This view will probably come to fruition at the end of the current quarter, when sales from the new iPhone, along with the new iPad, will be counted. Furthermore, if Apple maintains its tradition of introducing a completely brand new iPhone every 2 years, then the iPhone 7 should put Apple back on its path to sustained growth.

Public sector strikes in Germany’s many airports have caused more than a 1,000 flights to be canceled affecting as many as 89,000 travelers who were flying out of, or had a layover, in Frankfurt, Cologne and, Dusseldorf. The strikes, were carried out by ground services, security, fire safety and check-in staff, who staged a walk-out in order to assist the Union in their continuing battle against Lufthsana, Germany’s largest airline operator. The workers have been in conflict with the airline giant over pay and early retirement provisions.\r\n\r\nAcross Germany, these walk-outs were carried out into various industries, including the metals and electrical industries where close to 100,000 workers participated. In the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the home of car brands Porsche and Mercedes, more than 37,000 workers from more than 150 companies joined walkouts on Friday. The unions had initially demanded a pay hike of 6 percent for the next 12 months while public sector employers had offered a wage increase of 3 percent over two years. Though a deal was reached on Friday, April 29th; it includes a pay hike of 2.4 percent for this year, starting retroactively on March 1, and another increase of 2.35 percent starting next February.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that, in France many are also protesting similar issues, including a labor reform, which many say, will put French workers in a worse position with less protections and less benefits at a time when the French unemployment rate is rising. It is comforting to see that the German government took action so quickly in order to reach a concession with it’s citizens.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-germany-strike-idUSKCN0XQ14E<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-germany-strike-idUSKCN0XO0B4<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-germany-strike-idUSKCN0XO0B4<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2015\/may\/22\/strikes-sweeping-germany-here-to-stay<\/li>\r\n \t<li>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/worldviews\/wp\/2016\/04\/15\/merkel-allows-prosecution-of-german-comedian-who-mocked-turkish-president\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

It is comforting to see that the German government took action so quickly in order to reach a concession with it’s citizens.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-germany-strike-idUSKCN0XQ14E<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-germany-strike-idUSKCN0XO0B4<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-germany-strike-idUSKCN0XO0B4<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2015\/may\/22\/strikes-sweeping-germany-here-to-stay<\/li>\r\n \t<li>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/worldviews\/wp\/2016\/04\/15\/merkel-allows-prosecution-of-german-comedian-who-mocked-turkish-president\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Erynn Hughes\r\n\r\nMarch 28, 2016\r\n\r\nOne of the most important principles to remember when making journal entries in accounting is how to record assets that cannot be seen or touched. These types of resources are known as intangibles, and include patents, intellectual property, trademarks, goodwill, client lists, and even franchise agreements. The calculation of assigning value on these materials is complex and susceptible to change. For this reason, U.S. companies don’t record these items on their books as assets under current accounting rules. From an investor’s perspective, the absence of intangibles inhibits their ability to accurately determine potential risks. Other analysts say they don’t require this specific value because the company’s stock price reveals the market’s assessment of these assets. In my opinion, I believe that it depends on how long the business has been in existence. High levels of consumer awareness and customer satisfaction truly affect a company's brand image. One cannot precisely select this amount as there are too many variables in play.\r\n\r\nA large number of businesses are investing more in nonphysical assets than tangible resources these days. Based on Carol Corrado’s research from 2014, companies’ investment in intangibles and physical assets totaled 14% and 10% of private sector’s GDP, respectively. The opposite was true 40 years earlier, when 13% went to tangibles and 9% to abstract materials.\r\n\r\nAccording to economist Leonard Nakamura of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, American corporations could have more than $8 trillion in intangible assets, which is almost half of the combined $17.9 trillion market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500 index. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently in the process of updating its rules to recognize the increasing significance of intangibles. Although it’s still in the early stages of development, this could lead to a new rule that requires companies to put these assets on their balance sheet. They will no longer underrepresent their book value by accounting for (formerly) priceless, untouchable matter.\r\n\r\nA main issue that will influence this addition is whether its value will depend on how much it costs to create, or if managers have to estimate the fair value of these assets. The FASB also understands that it is much more difficult to measure the depreciating value of intangibles over time. If in fact an asset of this kind has a finite useful life, a company is required to amortize it—just as they would depreciate a physical asset’s value. At the end of each fiscal year, the income statement will reflect this decrease in an account called “amortization expense.” It is important to note that not all intangibles should be amortized if it continues to deliver economic value to a business indefinitely. In these cases, value should be periodically reviewed and adjusted to fluctuating conditions in a process known as “impairment.” This is where the FASB’s new rule would step in. Otherwise, “you’re leaving a lot to the imagination,” Corrado said. It is too soon to predict the future complications that may arise when a company inaccurately assigns value to its intangibles in response to this new principle.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/accountings-21st-century-challenge-how-to-value-intangible-assets-1458605126?cb=logged0.7123741258472687<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.fool.com\/knowledge-center\/2016\/02\/28\/how-to-calculate-the-amortization-of-intangible-as.aspx<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/3950716-many-companies-trade-many-multiples-book-value<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Matthew Choon\r\n\r\nMarch 24, 2016\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that during a technological boom, corporations must be one step ahead of their competitors to survive. This may be the reason why Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, is considering selling part of Intel’s venture capital unit (Intel Capital) as a potential source of capital. The company is instead looking to invest in American and Chinese-based startups in shifting technological fields. The potential sale of assets will provide Intel with more access and resources to focus on areas capable of complementing its business strategies.\r\n\r\nIntel’s previous concentration in PC’s is a stationary market. Today’s growing technology market is heavily focused on data centers, mobile devices, cloud computing, enterprise software, and the Internet. These tools dominate research and development focuses. Although Intel Capital plans to sell a hefty $1 billion worth of assets to secondary private equity firms, this strategy sacrifices just a small portion of Intel’s portfolio. Its total investments since 1991 amount to around $11.64 billion across 430 active investments. Headed by Wendell Brooks, the venture capital unit invested $514 million across 143 companies among sectors including digital media, security, and wearable technology last year.\r\n\r\nIntel has yet to make a comment about the move, but right after Brooks blogged about the continuation of $300 to $500 million worth of annual investments in tech startups in February, the share price rose 51 cents and has been increasing since. Current price per share is $32.34.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/article\/intel-intc-plans-to-sell-venture-capital-assets-worth-1b-cm593596#ixzz43T9mqgd0<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/intel-considers-sale-of-some-venture-capital-assets-to-refocus-resources-1457739505<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.groundreport.com\/intel-considers-selling-some-venture-capital-assets\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Matthew Choon\r\n\r\nMarch 24, 2016\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that during a technological boom, corporations must be one step ahead of their competitors to survive. This may be the reason why Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, is considering selling part of Intel’s venture capital unit (Intel Capital) as a potential source of capital. The company is instead looking to invest in American and Chinese-based startups in shifting technological fields. The potential sale of assets will provide Intel with more access and resources to focus on areas capable of complementing its business strategies.\r\n\r\nIntel’s previous concentration in PC’s is a stationary market. Today’s growing technology market is heavily focused on data centers, mobile devices, cloud computing, enterprise software, and the Internet. These tools dominate research and development focuses. Although Intel Capital plans to sell a hefty $1 billion worth of assets to secondary private equity firms, this strategy sacrifices just a small portion of Intel’s portfolio. Its total investments since 1991 amount to around $11.64 billion across 430 active investments. Headed by Wendell Brooks, the venture capital unit invested $514 million across 143 companies among sectors including digital media, security, and wearable technology last year.\r\n\r\nIntel has yet to make a comment about the move, but right after Brooks blogged about the continuation of $300 to $500 million worth of annual investments in tech startups in February, the share price rose 51 cents and has been increasing since. Current price per share is $32.34.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/article\/intel-intc-plans-to-sell-venture-capital-assets-worth-1b-cm593596#ixzz43T9mqgd0<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/intel-considers-sale-of-some-venture-capital-assets-to-refocus-resources-1457739505<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.groundreport.com\/intel-considers-selling-some-venture-capital-assets\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Recently, Hudson’s Bay’s Executive Chairman, Richard Baker, set his sights on a new acquisition: Neiman Marcus.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Neiman-Marcus.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-311 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Neiman-Marcus-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Soure: TheHuffingtonPost<\/p>\r\nNeiman Marcus currently has $4.9 billion in outstanding debt. At this point, the company has enough cash and credit to operate until the end of the fiscal year, but the debt is unsustainable. Hudson’s Bay is currently searching for a way to buy out Neiman Marcus, without acquiring its debt.\r\n\r\nNeiman has been faltering in the changing retail market. It is unable to compete with the competitive prices of retailers like Macy’s or Lord &amp; Taylor and can not top the convenience of online retailers like Amazon.

With the constant threat of a vicious deflationary cycle, people are cutting down on their purchases in fear of the uncertain economy, which in turn leads to lower profits for business and decreasing cash-flows to employees.\r\n\r\nIn order to stimulate the economy, the European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered its interest rates to ensure that there is adequate money supply to prevent this deflationary spiral. One of the ECB’s primary strategies was the decrease in the deposit rate, the rate at which banks earn interest on money stored within the ECB, which currently sits at -0.03%.  This negative interest rate means that banks have to pay interest charges to the ECB for storing their money.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t the only tactic the ECB used to combat the threat of deflation. Over a year ago, the ECB embarked on their quantitative easing strategy. Despite the failure of the quantitative easing program and the current deflation, Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal believes “there is little evidence that current disinflation is feeding through to the kind of self-fulfilling deflationary spiral.”\r\n\r\nHowever, most carry more bleak outlooks because of the failure of Draghi’s quantitative easing program. The plan served as the primary strategy in efforts to  achieve the target inflationary rate of just below 2%, a prime inflation rate among all central banks. The philosophy behind the quantitative easing plan was that with the purchasing of government bonds and other safe assets, the ECB would effectively impact the interest rates. The large-scale demand for bonds would increase bond prices, which in turn would inversely affect interest rates. The resulting low interest rates would make it easier for businesses to borrow money, money that would eventually make its way into the equity market. While the reasoning is sound, the plan failed to reach its goal. Actually, 52 weeks into the program the Euro Stoxx index has dropped 16%.\r\n\r\nIn their most recent meeting this past week, the ECB made a decision to drop the rate to -.04%, a more significant decrease than projected. With no surprise, the ECB implemented a shift in its bond-purchasing plan, from sixty billion to eighty billion euros a month. Additionally, instead of solely purchasing government bonds and safe assets, the ECB will begin to purchase corporate debt.\r\n\r\nBy doing so, the ECB proved that it was willing to do whatever it takes to meet, if not beat, the anticipated inflation rate. However, the ECB will have to break the three-year trend of failing to meet inflation expectations.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Bird, Mike. \"Don’t Get Your Hopes Up for the ECB to Spark a Rally in Stocks.\" WSJ.

While his ability to do so is certainly questionable, it is difficult to judge whether or not America is doing as well as it was in the past. U.S. productivity growth has stalled, and while we know that Trump is ready to put on his cape and fly off to rescue the country, it may be best to pinpoint the actual cause of the lack of growth.\r\n\r\nJ.P. Morgan Chase theorizes that the reason U.S. productivity growth has stalled is that the American workforce is less skilled than it used to be. According to J.P. Morgan and the San Francisco Federal Reserve, the labor quality of an average worker has steeply declined since 2008 along with college enrollment which has declined after peaking in 2011.  While some of the downward trend is cyclical and can be attributed to the recession, U.S. labor quality is actually lower than where it was in the 1940s.\r\n\r\nAnother benchmark that J.P. Morgan economists Michael Feroli and Robert Mellman analyze in their report is worker productivity. According to their report, productivity has grown at only 0.7% annually over the past three years, a much lower growth compared to the average 2.9% growth between 1995 and 2005. The key in reversing this trend lies in the workforce’s ability to gain the skills and education necessary for the economy’s continued development.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2016\/02\/29\/how-a-less-skilled-american-workforce-may-be-holding-back-growth\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.jobsnhire.com\/articles\/36770\/20160303\/less-skilled-american-workforce-holding-back-growth.htm<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Othilla Wlodarczyk\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 2016\r\n\r\n“Make America Great Again.” The premise of Donald Trump’s campaign is that America has lost its greatness and he is the only one who can re-instill it. While his ability to do so is certainly questionable, it is difficult to judge whether or not America is doing as well as it was in the past. U.S. productivity growth has stalled, and while we know that Trump is ready to put on his cape and fly off to rescue the country, it may be best to pinpoint the actual cause of the lack of growth.\r\n\r\nJ.P. Morgan Chase theorizes that the reason U.S. productivity growth has stalled is that the American workforce is less skilled than it used to be. According to J.P. Morgan and the San Francisco Federal Reserve, the labor quality of an average worker has steeply declined since 2008 along with college enrollment which has declined after peaking in 2011.  While some of the downward trend is cyclical and can be attributed to the recession, U.S. labor quality is actually lower than where it was in the 1940s.\r\n\r\nAnother benchmark that J.P. Morgan economists Michael Feroli and Robert Mellman analyze in their report is worker productivity. According to their report, productivity has grown at only 0.7% annually over the past three years, a much lower growth compared to the average 2.9% growth between 1995 and 2005. The key in reversing this trend lies in the workforce’s ability to gain the skills and education necessary for the economy’s continued development.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2016\/02\/29\/how-a-less-skilled-american-workforce-may-be-holding-back-growth\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.jobsnhire.com\/articles\/36770\/20160303\/less-skilled-american-workforce-holding-back-growth.htm<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

By using this method, Emotient was able to acquire a patent for identifying approximately 100,000 facial images on a daily basis so that computers are better able to recognize and label different expressions.\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the news about the acquisition on Thursday, January 7th, though details regarding the deal were never disclosed. Emotient’s precise role and contributions to Apple therefore remain unclear, though several speculations have already been made to suggest possible ways in which Apple may be using its newly acquired artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nOne possibility is that Apple will partner up this technology with Siri, its personal assistant software that currently operates on human voice commands. If Siri is able to detect the user’s emotions, it could better tailor its responses. Another suggestion is that if Apple gathers sufficient and accurate information about the user’s mood, it could make adequate recommendations for the user to purchase other Apple products, such as movies, music, e-books, and more. So far, Emotient has gained a reputation within the advertising and marketing industries, where researchers have used the technology to learn about consumers’ preferences and get a sense of how customers feel about certain products.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of image recognition has been a hot topic in Silicon Valley, where Apple and its various competitors have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence techniques. According to Tractica, a market intelligence firm that analyzes global market opportunities surrounding human interaction with technology, the market for AI systems for enterprise applications will increase from $202.5 million in 2015 to $11.1 billion by 2024, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56.1%.\r\n\r\nFor now, users are anxious to find out how Apple will be using the new technology.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/apple-buys-artificial-intelligence-startup-emotient-1452188715<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/technology\/apple-emotiont-1.3400458\\<\/li>\r\n \t<li>https:\/\/www.tractica.com\/research\/artificial-intelligence-for-enterprise-applications\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2016\/01\/07\/apple-has-reportedly-acquired-facial-expression-recognition-startup-emotient\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

What triggered Saudi Arabia’s rash decision were the events that followed after this past Sunday, when the Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a Shiite cleric, was executed in Saudi Arabia. Not only was the Sheikh executed, but so were 47 other men who were suspected of being a part of Al Qaeda and partaking in terrorism-related activities. Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr outwardly criticized the Saudi royal family and was adamantly opposed to Sunni power. Seen as a high level threat to an already unstable Saudi government, Sheikh al-Nimr was accused of encouraging rebellions and violent protests, thus leading to his execution.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the Shiite cleric has led to further heated and violent protests in Saudi Arabia. Iranian protestors stormed the Saudi embassy in Iran’s capital, Tehran, this past weekend. Molotov cocktails were thrown at the embassy and protestors ransacked the building, hoping to get revenge for the death of the Sheikh. Due to the severity of the situation, Saudi Arabia ordered Iranian officials to evacuate the country within the next 48 hours.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the Shiite cleric seems to have further cemented the split between the Sunni and Shiite-supporting countries, thus supplementing greater tension in the Middle East. Predominantly Shiite countries, including Iraq are outraged by Saudi Arabia’s execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, for they believe the Sheikh was simply a peaceful dissident and wasn’t a threat to anyone. To the Shiite community’s dismay, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies have not spoken out against the execution.\r\n\r\nGeopolitical discrepancies and the recent involvement in proxy wars in Syria have undoubtedly been fueling the animosity between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the recent executions, which has been the largest execution to have taken place in the Middle East for decades, has sealed the deal in terms of severed ties between the two nations. The Obama administration has been advocating for peace between the two nations, but as of now, the split between the two nations seems almost unchangeable.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/04\/world\/middleeast\/iran-saudi-arabia-execution-sheikh-nimr.html?_r=0<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/03\/world\/middleeast\/saudi-arabia-executes-47-sheikh-nimr-shiite-cleric.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Middle%20East&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2016\/01\/03\/saudi-arabia-cuts-ties-with-iran-foreign-minister-says.html<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Iranian protestors stormed the Saudi embassy in Iran’s capital, Tehran, this past weekend. Molotov cocktails were thrown at the embassy and protestors ransacked the building, hoping to get revenge for the death of the Sheikh. Due to the severity of the situation, Saudi Arabia ordered Iranian officials to evacuate the country within the next 48 hours.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the Shiite cleric seems to have further cemented the split between the Sunni and Shiite-supporting countries, thus supplementing greater tension in the Middle East. Predominantly Shiite countries, including Iraq are outraged by Saudi Arabia’s execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, for they believe the Sheikh was simply a peaceful dissident and wasn’t a threat to anyone. To the Shiite community’s dismay, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies have not spoken out against the execution.\r\n\r\nGeopolitical discrepancies and the recent involvement in proxy wars in Syria have undoubtedly been fueling the animosity between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the recent executions, which has been the largest execution to have taken place in the Middle East for decades, has sealed the deal in terms of severed ties between the two nations. The Obama administration has been advocating for peace between the two nations, but as of now, the split between the two nations seems almost unchangeable.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/04\/world\/middleeast\/iran-saudi-arabia-execution-sheikh-nimr.html?_r=0<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/03\/world\/middleeast\/saudi-arabia-executes-47-sheikh-nimr-shiite-cleric.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Middle%20East&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2016\/01\/03\/saudi-arabia-cuts-ties-with-iran-foreign-minister-says.html<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Erynn Hughes\r\n\r\nJanuary 10, 2016\r\n\r\nWithin the first week of the New Year, China’s stock market has already tumbled despite calculated measures employed to prevent rapid price changes. These recent developments alarm investors of possible instability and market decline, as experienced in the previous year. In 2015, China experienced huge stock market volatility, including a devaluation of its yuan currency, falling imports and exports, and a rising concern about nonperforming loans. In January, the Shanghai composite index started at a value of 3,350, rose to a high of 5,178 in June, and then fell to a low of 2,850 in August. In response to the downward trend, the Chinese central bank cut interest rates and regulators organized the purchase of shares with cash supplied by the central bank. After the crash during the summer—which resulted in trillions of dollars in losses—Chinese markets managed to recover in the last couple of months of 2015. But this stability did not last long going into the New Year.\r\n\r\nIntroduced for the first time on January 4th, 2016, the circuit-breaker mechanism was just one of the numerous new rules initiated by Chinese regulators to limit volatility, guarantee stock trading functionality, and avoid irrational price swings. The concept of the circuit-breaker is that if the overall market index (CSI 300) experiences high volatility, then there must be something unusual in the market as a whole and so all trading must stop. Under this mechanism, trading in all stocks would be halted for 15 minutes if the CSI 300 index rises or falls by 5%, so as to let the investors “cool down.” After this short break, trading would resume; and if the market continues to rise or fall an additional 2% (for a daily total of +\/-7%), then trading would cease for the entire day, as it did on January 4th. The drop on January 4th can be attributed to several factors: weak manufacturing figures, lower expectations for China’s GDP growth in 2016, lower credibility of official macro statistics, and even the implementation of the new circuit-breaker regulation.\r\n\r\nFor the second time this week, trading in the Shanghai stock market suspended on January 7th after the markets reopened and losses dropped 7% in seconds. Chinese stocks initially traded for less than 30 minutes before entering the 15-minute break period. One of the unintended consequences of the circuit-breaker mechanism is that shareholders on the margins have an added incentive to sell stocks more quickly than ever before. The reason why this mechanism encourages investors to sell more (while initially aiming to limit losses) is because once the first breaker is reached too quickly, experts believe that investors use the cool down 15-minute period to line up additional sell orders. This creates more chaos as stockholders sell out of fear that they won’t be able to recover their investments before trading is stopped. Peter Lewis, Director of Peter Lewis Consulting, said, “People think this is a manipulated, distorted market.” Because the market is not open, Lewis thinks that foreign institutions will be very alarmed by the selling restrictions.\r\n\r\nOther rules that regulators intend to implement attempt to sharply decrease stock sales. In any three-month time period, major shareholders are allowed to unload only 1% of their holdings, and they must disclose their intentions at least 15 days in advance. In the first week of 2016, the CSI 300 index of companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen has already fallen 12%. Analysts expect further volatility in the Shanghai stock market in the coming months. In a recent survey conducted by CNNMoney, it found that most investing professionals listed China as the largest risk to U.S. stocks. The first Chinese market suspension of the year sparked a global selloff, causing losses of approximately 2% in the U.S. After the second stoppage, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 392 points, the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 dropped by 2.4%, and the Nasdaq decreased 3%.\r\n\r\nChina recently held an emergency meeting on January 7th to suspend circuit-breakers effective the following day. Chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group Peter Boockvar believes that this decision will ease pressure on Chinese stocks in the short-run but won’t be a lasting solution to their mounting issues.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/theconversation.com\/chinas-stock-market-is-in-for-a-turbulent-2016-52731<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/01\/06\/investing\/china-stocks-halted\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/01\/07\/investing\/stocks-markets-dow-china\/index.html<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/la-fi-china-economy-2016-20151210-story.html<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

(Source: Reuter)\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 2016, Venezuelan oil minister Eulogio Del Pino met with Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi in Riyadh to discuss plans for stabilizing the global oil market. Del Pino is meeting with other crude oil producers, including Russia, Qatar, and Iran on a global tour to coordinate a meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries, which currently produce 40 percent of the world’s oil. Because oil production reached an all time high in January, Venezuela is attempting to convince OPEC leaders to cut down production in order to prop up prices.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia faces rising threats to its oil industry in U.S. shale production and Iranian sales. As shale gas production is a relatively young industry, the United States has not yet reformed its infrastructure and policy regulations to maximize its profits. However, the United States and its NAFTA partner, Canada are the two largest shale producers in the world and pose a future threat to Saudi oil dominance. At the same time, Iran is trying to recover its market share of crude oil, lost during the 2012 international sanctions.

(Source: Reuter)\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 2016, Venezuelan oil minister Eulogio Del Pino met with Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi in Riyadh to discuss plans for stabilizing the global oil market. Del Pino is meeting with other crude oil producers, including Russia, Qatar, and Iran on a global tour to coordinate a meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries, which currently produce 40 percent of the world’s oil. Because oil production reached an all time high in January, Venezuela is attempting to convince OPEC leaders to cut down production in order to prop up prices.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia faces rising threats to its oil industry in U.S. shale production and Iranian sales. As shale gas production is a relatively young industry, the United States has not yet reformed its infrastructure and policy regulations to maximize its profits. However, the United States and its NAFTA partner, Canada are the two largest shale producers in the world and pose a future threat to Saudi oil dominance. At the same time, Iran is trying to recover its market share of crude oil, lost during the 2012 international sanctions. The sanctions were lifted in January and Iran immediately increased sales as rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq increased supply. Iran is poised to add one million barrels a day to its production by the end of this year. Saudi Arabia is unlikely to agree to reduce production and raise prices, which could allow competitors to fill the demand and threaten its position as the world’s largest oil exporter.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-02-07\/saudi-venezuela-oil-ministers-hold-successful-talks-on-market<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-saudi-oil-venezuela-idUSKCN0VG0MD<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.eia.gov\/todayinenergy\/detail.cfm?id=19991<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/02\/04\/news\/opec-emergency-meeting-venezuela\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/business\/energy\/2016\/02\/07\/Saudi-Venezuela-talk-of-OPEC-non-OPEC-cooperation-to-stabilize-oil-market.html<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

(Susana Gonzalez\/Bloomberg News)\r\n\r\nFord is expanding its manufacturing capacity in Mexico to more than double its current output. Ford produced 433,000 vehicles in Mexico last year, 14% of its North American production, and plans to increase that output by 500,000 units. By 2018, Ford will have spent more than $1 billion to expand its existing Cuautitlán plant to encompass 150,000 more units annually and build a new plant in San Luis Potosi that will generate 350,000 units annually. Ford will be producing up to three models at the new assembly complex, including a new hybrid vehicle (to compete with Toyota’s electric Prius) and the Focus compact car (currently being produced by unionized workers in Michigan). This shift will allow its American factories to focus on the more profitable trucks and sports-utility vehicles.\r\n\r\nAmerican automobile manufacturers, including the top six automakers competing in the U.S. market, have been investing billions in their Mexico plants over the last few years. Last spring, Ford announced a $2.5 billion investment directed at building an engine and transmission plant in Mexico. Mexico’s inexpensive labor force, favorable free trade agreements, and proximity are undermining the UAW’s (United Auto Workers union) efforts to increase worker wages and keep jobs in the United States. Ford’s intention to double its Mexico production capacity was released after the union ratified expensive new labor agreements last November with the “Big Three” headquartered in Detroit, the automotive giants Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. UAW President Dennis Williams stated that there is no need to jump ahead to outsource manufacturing to countries like Mexico, Taiwan, and Thailand, because car companies are already profitable enough without the fatter profit margin provided by low wages overseas. Mexican labor wages are approximately one-fifth of the domestic automotive laborers’ wages (approaching $30 an hour in the next few years). On the other hand, Ford’s decision may maximize its shareholder returns, offsetting the harmful effects of outsourcing. A Ford spokesperson declined to comment on the future plans.\r\n\r\nFord’s expansion south of the border may have strong ramifications for the coming 2016 presidential election. Last year, presidential candidate, Donald Trump, speculating that Ford planned to build a new assembly plant in Mexico and simultaneously close Michigan factories, promised to put in place a 35% tax on all automotive imports from Mexico if elected. As a result of his prediction coming true, Donald Trump may win even more supporters. Despite this, we have yet to see whether the growing trend of car companies outsourcing labor will affect the American economy positively or negatively in coming years.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Bunkley, Nick. \"Ford's Mexico Expansion Plans Amount to a Nice Gift for Trump.\" Automotive News.

    "post_content": "Chris Angelidis\r\n\r\nApril 20, 2016\r\n\r\nEvery semester, colleges expect students to pay for tuition, student fees, room and board, textbooks, online access codes, cafeteria food, transportation, and other living expenses. These countless costs quickly add up and put the average college student thirty-thousand dollars in debt by the end of his\/her undergraduate degree. As of 2014, there were forty-million people in America with student loan debt and the number has only grown since then. With over twelve percent of the nation’s population in student loan related debt, it is important to look at this the long-term and macro implications of this issue.\r\n\r\nRecent studies have shown that millennials try to get rid of their debt at one time instead of financing it over a lifetime. This means that a significant portion of our early career income will go towards paying off these large fees, leaving us short of cash. Furthermore, these substantial payments lessen the amount of money put aside for retirement, causing people in the generation to lose out on $325,000 in their 401k’s over the course of a lifetime and delaying retirement as a result. A recent survey conducted by Forbes even reported that thirty-percent of millennials would be willing to sell an organ to get rid of their student debt.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the student loan crisis is heavily impacting millennials and their ability to stand as independent adults. Each year, more and more young workers are choosing to live with their parents and are forced to put off important life decisions. This unfortunate situation has largely influenced the political scene, with presidential candidate Bernie Sanders offering to provide free public collegiate education for all. Such a move would not only provide the opportunity for students to graduate from college debt free, but would also increase college attendance by those who would otherwise be unwilling or unable to take out a loan.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2014\/09\/10\/pf\/college\/student-loans\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/maggiemcgrath\/2015\/09\/09\/desperate-and-in-debt-30-of-millennials-would-sell-an-organ-to-get-rid-of-student-loans\/#5ee13297127a<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-10\/four-ways-student-debt-is-wreaking-havoc-on-millennials<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Chris Angelidis\r\n\r\nApril 20, 2016\r\n\r\nEvery semester, colleges expect students to pay for tuition, student fees, room and board, textbooks, online access codes, cafeteria food, transportation, and other living expenses. These countless costs quickly add up and put the average college student thirty-thousand dollars in debt by the end of his\/her undergraduate degree. As of 2014, there were forty-million people in America with student loan debt and the number has only grown since then. With over twelve percent of the nation’s population in student loan related debt, it is important to look at this the long-term and macro implications of this issue.\r\n\r\nRecent studies have shown that millennials try to get rid of their debt at one time instead of financing it over a lifetime. This means that a significant portion of our early career income will go towards paying off these large fees, leaving us short of cash. Furthermore, these substantial payments lessen the amount of money put aside for retirement, causing people in the generation to lose out on $325,000 in their 401k’s over the course of a lifetime and delaying retirement as a result. A recent survey conducted by Forbes even reported that thirty-percent of millennials would be willing to sell an organ to get rid of their student debt.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the student loan crisis is heavily impacting millennials and their ability to stand as independent adults. Each year, more and more young workers are choosing to live with their parents and are forced to put off important life decisions. This unfortunate situation has largely influenced the political scene, with presidential candidate Bernie Sanders offering to provide free public collegiate education for all. Such a move would not only provide the opportunity for students to graduate from college debt free, but would also increase college attendance by those who would otherwise be unwilling or unable to take out a loan.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2014\/09\/10\/pf\/college\/student-loans\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/maggiemcgrath\/2015\/09\/09\/desperate-and-in-debt-30-of-millennials-would-sell-an-organ-to-get-rid-of-student-loans\/#5ee13297127a<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-10\/four-ways-student-debt-is-wreaking-havoc-on-millennials<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Chatbots are interactive software agents powered by both artificial and human intelligence. They are designed to simulate human conversation. Chatbots will pop up on messaging services where you can use them to perform simple tasks, such as to ask questions or make a purchase. Zuckerbergs plans to incorporate chatbots into the existing and very popular Facebook Messenger app. Users will be able to chat with businesses just as if they were to message their friends. This eliminates the burden of downloading an excessive numbers of apps, an issue that Zuckerberg is hoping to resolve with chatbots.\r\n\r\nDuring the conference, Zuckerberg said \"To order flowers on 1-800-Flowers, you never have to call 1-800-Flowers again.\" Facebook has been testing this idea out – it partnered with Uber last year so that users can order a ride without having the Uber app on their phone. In China, chatbots have already taken off through the popular messaging app WeChat, where users can schedule doctor’s appointments, play games, and send money.\r\n\r\nProfiting from bots isn't the first priority for Facebook, but analysts see great potential. Capturing half the predicted business for customer support via messaging would represent a brand-new $4 billion revenue opportunity, says Evercore Group LLC.

First, there has been a sharp drop in domestic investments, particularly in the real estate sector and other capital-intensive industries, although this will be partly offset by increased government spending on infrastructure. There is also an oversupply in the steel and coal sectors, which have been producing up to 30% more than the market currently needs.

However, for the founders and CEO’s, Suhail Doshi and Tim Trefen, are inspired “re-up the risk in the startup.” Opening multiple offices abroad, tripling its sales staff, and developing a new line of analytical software to even further analyze the intricacies of the apps in terms of sales and finance, the company was valued at around $865 million dollars by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

Mixpanel is now facing an important question: Is it worth the sacrifice of profitability for the gain of growth?\r\n\r\nMixpanel provides a platform for apps to view the particular actions their subscribers are taking within the app, as well as make changes to cater to the particular interests and actions of their users. However, for the founders and CEO’s, Suhail Doshi and Tim Trefen, are inspired “re-up the risk in the startup.” Opening multiple offices abroad, tripling its sales staff, and developing a new line of analytical software to even further analyze the intricacies of the apps in terms of sales and finance, the company was valued at around $865 million dollars by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. This 2014 valuation just missed the $1 billion unicorn status that the founders sought.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it will reach unicorn status within the next few months or even years is unknown for Mixpanel, but the company certainly has a bright future. Gaining its profitability within a short four years with little to no marketing, it came to no surprise when Sequoia Capital and other elite “angel” investors caught on to the company.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/venturecapital\/2016\/04\/11\/mixpanel-ceos-unicorn-dreams-take-a-back-seat-to-cutting-costs\/<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

However, NTT Data’s latest acquisition of Perot Systems, Dell’s IT services branch appears to be the most promising acquisition thus far.

This will certainly not be the only department that Denali Holding Inc., Dell’s parent company will try to sell in the upcoming weeks leading to the acquisition of EMC Corp. For some, the sale of Perot Systems to NTT Data for only $3.05 billion came as a surprise.

The personal computer and printer producing company aims to seize a greater market share of the premium PC category with the HP Spectre. CEO Dion Weisler hopes it will help rebrand HP with the aesthetic sleekness and innovation currently associated with Apple Inc’s high-priced portable electronics. Hewlett Packard unveiled the upgraded model at The New York Times International Luxury Conference in Versailles on Monday, April 4th. The 13.3’’ notebook is as thin as an AAA battery (1.04 centimeters thick), with a black and gold finish. However, HP developed the Spectre for portability and design, trading off functionality. While the new model boasts a 9.5 hour battery life, it is said to have limited upgrade capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe unveiling of the HP Spectre comes at a time of subpar performance for the tech giant. In the last fiscal year, HP’s revenue fell 12%. Unit sales in 2015 fell 5.9%, though HP boosted its share of global shipments from 18.4% to 19.4%. In light of these figures, HP developed the trendy new clamshell model, slimmest of its kind, hoping to turn around sales. But premium laptops may be the wrong category to fall back on. Stephen Baker, an analyst at NPD Group tracking US retail PC sales, said that such systems make up only a small share of the portable electronic market. “The challenge for doing really, really thin and light products is it’s a very, very thin and light segment to go after,” Mr. Baker said.

However, the recent Wells Fargo scandal has called into question the efficacy and impact of Dodd-Frank reforms. Earlier this month, Wells Fargo was charged with creating over 2 million fake accounts in an attempt to meet aggressive sales quotas. The bank has agreed to pay a $185 million settlement and has fired 5,300 employees in the aftermath of the scandal. In Janet Yellen’s upcoming meeting with the House Financial Services Committee, this will likely be one of the issues brought up in the discussion of the Fed’s supervision and regulation arms. In addition, Wells Fargo CEO, John Stumpf, will be asked to testify at a hearing scheduled with the House of Financial Services Committee later this week.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming supervision hearing was introduced by Dodd-Frank, however it is important to note that it lacks a key player. Under the same reform that mandated the hearings, the president was required to appoint a Vice Chairman for Supervision. Since the Obama administration has failed to select someone to this position, Janet Yellen is taking over this role.\r\n\r\nAlthough Yellen's meeting with the House of Financial Services Committee will be centered around regulation concerns, it is likely that there will be continued pressure for rate hikes by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/yellen-to-testify-on-capitol-hill-wednesday-on-bank-supervision-1474577331<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Anand Poonai\r\n\r\nJanuary 10, 2016\r\n\r\n1400 years have gone by and the prolonged sectarian division between Shiite and Sunni Muslim has recently taken a turn for the worst, leading to a Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia’s official severing of ties with the predominantly Shiite Iran. What triggered Saudi Arabia’s rash decision were the events that followed after this past Sunday, when the Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a Shiite cleric, was executed in Saudi Arabia. Not only was the Sheikh executed, but so were 47 other men who were suspected of being a part of Al Qaeda and partaking in terrorism-related activities. Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr outwardly criticized the Saudi royal family and was adamantly opposed to Sunni power. Seen as a high level threat to an already unstable Saudi government, Sheikh al-Nimr was accused of encouraging rebellions and violent protests, thus leading to his execution.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the Shiite cleric has led to further heated and violent protests in Saudi Arabia. Iranian protestors stormed the Saudi embassy in Iran’s capital, Tehran, this past weekend. Molotov cocktails were thrown at the embassy and protestors ransacked the building, hoping to get revenge for the death of the Sheikh. Due to the severity of the situation, Saudi Arabia ordered Iranian officials to evacuate the country within the next 48 hours.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the Shiite cleric seems to have further cemented the split between the Sunni and Shiite-supporting countries, thus supplementing greater tension in the Middle East. Predominantly Shiite countries, including Iraq are outraged by Saudi Arabia’s execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, for they believe the Sheikh was simply a peaceful dissident and wasn’t a threat to anyone. To the Shiite community’s dismay, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies have not spoken out against the execution.\r\n\r\nGeopolitical discrepancies and the recent involvement in proxy wars in Syria have undoubtedly been fueling the animosity between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the recent executions, which has been the largest execution to have taken place in the Middle East for decades, has sealed the deal in terms of severed ties between the two nations. The Obama administration has been advocating for peace between the two nations, but as of now, the split between the two nations seems almost unchangeable.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/04\/world\/middleeast\/iran-saudi-arabia-execution-sheikh-nimr.html?_r=0<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/03\/world\/middleeast\/saudi-arabia-executes-47-sheikh-nimr-shiite-cleric.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Middle%20East&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2016\/01\/03\/saudi-arabia-cuts-ties-with-iran-foreign-minister-says.html<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "<h5>Katherine Virgino<\/h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, technology giants Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) and longstanding partner, BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY) agreed to a binding arbitration to settle a yearlong dispute in regard to a pre-arranged cap concerning licensing payments, which ultimately awarded BlackBerry $815 million.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Blackberry.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-335 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Blackberry-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Android Authority<\/p>\r\nQualcomm, self-described as a ‘world leader in 3G and next-generation mobile technologies,’ is an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications company, and licenses patents necessary for mobile communication, thus collecting royalties on nearly every smartphone in the market. The company charges its licensing fees based on a percentage up to 5% of the average selling price of a device, but its agreement with BlackBerry prior to the arbitration decision included a cap on such fees. After recently reporting a second-quarter profit of $749 million on total sales of $5.02 billion, this arbitration decision cut greatly into Qualcomm’s top line, decreasing revenue in its patent licensing segment by 40% to $1.33 billion.\r\n\r\nAlthough this particular case has had no impact on Qualcomm’s licensing agreements with other partners and notable clients, the company has faced a very recent $1 billion lawsuit with Cupertino-based giant, Apple, concerning similar ‘inordinately high’ prices for its technologies. Likewise, Qualcomm has also faced legal action from the Federal Trade Commission in addition to South Korea and China’s regulatory authorities regarding anti-competitive practices. As this chipmaker is under attack, how much can it continue to profit from its seemingly monopolistic intellectual property?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what does this mean for BlackBerry? After reporting unusually large adjusted earnings in its last quarter, the company has begun an expansion of its licensing strategy into other technology components – including wearables, tablets, appliances, medical devices, and possibly automobile software. Immediately after its $815 million arbitration agreement, BBRY stocks shot up 16%, as BlackBerry stockholders are aware of the additional cushion to its balance sheet. Although the company has been lagging behind competitors such as Apple and Samsung for quite some time, BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen has since stated that he expects BlackBerry’s software business to continue to grow 13% to 15% in the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThis legal dispute between BlackBerry and Qualcomm Inc. bring into light anti-competitive practices that continue to exist past the Rockefeller Age and into the ‘Age of the Smartphone.’ With several regulatory authorities recognizing Qualcomm’s control of the mobile technology realm, Qualcomm’s mobile technology competitors – including Huahei, HTC, Nokia, and Samsung – have more leverage now than ever to rise, improve product potential, and maximize revenue.\r\n\r\n<em>Sources<\/em>:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Brugger, T.

    "post_content": "With professional sports around the world reaching the height of their popularity, team valuations have begun to explode. In July 2016, Forbes published an article listing the most valuable sports franchises in the world, which was led by the Dallas Cowboys football team at $4 billion. That’s $1.37B more than your friendly-neighborhood GameStop (NYSE:GME). So what is it about sports teams that makes them so valuable? Let’s examine one specific NBA team, the New York Knicks, for example. The Knicks make money from their portion of the television deals the league has with Turner Sports and ESPN ($240M), their huge market ($1.456B), the money generated by MSG (ticket sales, non-basketball events, premium attractions, etc.) ($907M) and their specific brand ($447 M). All of those add up to a team valuation of ~$3 Billion. Reading that Forbes article got me thinking: why don’t sports teams offer shares on the public markets?\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/NBA-Image.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-291 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/NBA-Image-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>Source: espn.com<\/p>\r\nAs we just saw, buying a sports franchise is an expensive endeavor, one usually reserved for billionaires and the ultra-connected, but need that be the case? Why can’t franchise-owners, like CEOs that IPO their companies, look to the public markets to raise funds for a new stadium or to go after a highly-coveted free agent? What sports fan wouldn’t be interested in becoming a part-owner of their favorite team, even if they only owned a fraction of a percent?

A team’s valuation would undoubtedly be highly cyclical based on its recent performance (which would without a doubt impact all aspects of its revenue stream), but in the same way that value investors find the neglected stocks bound to soar, the smart money would see past the struggles of today and buy into the bright future.\r\n\r\nWhile there are, without a doubt, still issues that need to be resolved with this idea, I believe that such an offering would be attractive to both fans seeking to join in their team’s success and investors seeking above-market returns.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<u>Sources<\/u>:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/sports-franchises-triple-value-2012-7?op=1\/#-new-york-yankees-8\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/sports-franchises-triple-value-2012-7?op=1\/#-new-york-yankees-8<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/chrissmith\/2012\/08\/10\/manchester-united-ipo-history-says-dont-buy\/2\/#26bf237c7e49\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/chrissmith\/2012\/08\/10\/manchester-united-ipo-history-says-dont-buy\/2\/#26bf237c7e49<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/pictures\/mli45fgemg\/1-dallas-cowboys\/#6652b1db17b5\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/pictures\/mli45fgemg\/1-dallas-cowboys\/#6652b1db17b5<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=&amp;referrer=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#49a66450444f\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=&amp;referrer=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#49a66450444f<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Comcast’s X1 DVR allows its users to simultaneously record and watch 6 shows. Furthermore, you can download those shows and watch them where ever you go, with or without Wi-Fi. Another added bonus is the new ability to use a voice controlled X1 remote.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Comcast.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-294 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Comcast-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: YouTube<\/p>\r\nDespite these new and improved qualities of the X1, Comcast still competes against Roku and Google’s Chromecast, thereby motivating the company to bring its next greatest innovation: the integration of YouTube. \"We are excited to partner with Google to bring YouTube to X1 and provide our customers easier access to all the content they love in one place,\" said Sam Schwartz, Chief Business Development Officer, Comcast Cable.\r\n\r\nWith this new YouTube feature, X1 users can access YouTube’s videos via the app. Additionally the smart tech can also recommend videos based off of the channels and programs you watch on cable.This integration of an internet video provider with the traditional TV programming is not the first step Comcast has made. In fact, just last year Comcast integrated Netflix into its XI set up boxes as well.However, what are the implications of integrating traditional television programming and internet videos?\r\n\r\nWell for starters, it’s one of the first wide scale steps in separating the divide between “what you see on TV” and “what you see on the web.” As of right now, over 50% of the Internet’s bandwidth is consumed by Netflix and YouTube users alone. Both of these sites are now partnered with Comcast, thus creating a large demand for its cable and internet services. However, YouTube will still be taking in its full revenue from the ads they place in the services they provide without any commission to Comcast. The usual YouTube user could choose to completely bypass Comcast’s X1 box for YouTube Red, unless Comcast allows them to directly subscribe via X1, an opportunity not available as of right now.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this new bundle with the Comcast X1 set up box demonstrates the shift in Comcast’s video strategy by placing the customer experience before the competitive disputes. Comcast users look forward to this new launch of the YouTube app on X1 to be released later in 2017.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/corporate.comcast.com\/news-information\/news-feed\/comcast-to-launch-youtube-on-xfinity-x1\">http:\/\/corporate.comcast.com\/news-information\/news-feed\/comcast-to-launch-youtube-on-xfinity-x1<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/2\/27\/14747186\/comcast-youtube-x1-google-alphabet\">http:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/2\/27\/14747186\/comcast-youtube-x1-google-alphabet<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/philadelphia\/news\/2017\/02\/28\/comcast-brian-roberts-x1-youtube-netflix-fcc-pai.html\">http:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/philadelphia\/news\/2017\/02\/28\/comcast-brian-roberts-x1-youtube-netflix-fcc-pai.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;",

In July 2016, Forbes published an article listing the most valuable sports franchises in the world, which was led by the Dallas Cowboys football team at $4 billion. That’s $1.37B more than your friendly-neighborhood GameStop (NYSE:GME). So what is it about sports teams that makes them so valuable? Let’s examine one specific NBA team, the New York Knicks, for example. The Knicks make money from their portion of the television deals the league has with Turner Sports and ESPN ($240M), their huge market ($1.456B), the money generated by MSG (ticket sales, non-basketball events, premium attractions, etc.) ($907M) and their specific brand ($447 M). All of those add up to a team valuation of ~$3 Billion.

A team’s valuation would undoubtedly be highly cyclical based on its recent performance (which would without a doubt impact all aspects of its revenue stream), but in the same way that value investors find the neglected stocks bound to soar, the smart money would see past the struggles of today and buy into the bright future.\r\n\r\nWhile there are, without a doubt, still issues that need to be resolved with this idea, I believe that such an offering would be attractive to both fans seeking to join in their team’s success and investors seeking above-market returns.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<u>Sources<\/u>:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/sports-franchises-triple-value-2012-7?op=1\/#-new-york-yankees-8\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/sports-franchises-triple-value-2012-7?op=1\/#-new-york-yankees-8<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/chrissmith\/2012\/08\/10\/manchester-united-ipo-history-says-dont-buy\/2\/#26bf237c7e49\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/chrissmith\/2012\/08\/10\/manchester-united-ipo-history-says-dont-buy\/2\/#26bf237c7e49<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/pictures\/mli45fgemg\/1-dallas-cowboys\/#6652b1db17b5\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/pictures\/mli45fgemg\/1-dallas-cowboys\/#6652b1db17b5<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=&amp;referrer=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#49a66450444f\">https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=&amp;referrer=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/baileybrautigan\/2016\/03\/21\/where-all-that-money-comes-from-nba-team-valuations-visualized\/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#49a66450444f<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

As the company grew and expanded over time, it has become one of the oldest retail giants and acts as parent company to major retailers such as Lord &amp; Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Home Outfitters, and more. Recently, Hudson’s Bay’s Executive Chairman, Richard Baker, set his sights on a new acquisition: Neiman Marcus.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Neiman-Marcus.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-311 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Neiman-Marcus-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Soure: TheHuffingtonPost<\/p>\r\nNeiman Marcus currently has $4.9 billion in outstanding debt. At this point, the company has enough cash and credit to operate until the end of the fiscal year, but the debt is unsustainable. Hudson’s Bay is currently searching for a way to buy out Neiman Marcus, without acquiring its debt.\r\n\r\nNeiman has been faltering in the changing retail market. It is unable to compete with the competitive prices of retailers like Macy’s or Lord &amp; Taylor and can not top the convenience of online retailers like Amazon. The company either needs to go through drastic changes to attract millennial shoppers, or consider its acquisition opportunities\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/03\/14\/business\/dealbook\/neiman-marcus.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/03\/14\/business\/dealbook\/neiman-marcus.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-03-14\/a-neiman-saks-merger-would-create-luxury-empire-at-risky-moment\">https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-03-14\/a-neiman-saks-merger-would-create-luxury-empire-at-risky-moment<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-03-14\/neiman-marcus-is-considering-a-sale-of-company-following-slump\">https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-03-14\/neiman-marcus-is-considering-a-sale-of-company-following-slump<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/03\/14\/huhdsons-bay-in-discussions-to-buy-neiman-marcus-report.html\">http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/03\/14\/huhdsons-bay-in-discussions-to-buy-neiman-marcus-report.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www3.hbc.com\/hbc\/media-centre\/hudsons-bay-company-fact-sheet\/\">http:\/\/www3.hbc.com\/hbc\/media-centre\/hudsons-bay-company-fact-sheet\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/hudsons-bay-is-in-talks-to-buy-neiman-marcus-2017-3\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/hudsons-bay-is-in-talks-to-buy-neiman-marcus-2017-3<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Collin Chipetine\r\n\r\nMarch 22, 2017\r\n\r\nAIG recently revealed its fourth quarter earnings, which reported losses totaling approximately $3.04 billion, a loss marked as “the worst performance by the New York City-based firm since its near-collapse in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.” In response, AIG and its Chief Executive made a drastic decision in allowing the current CEO, Peter Hancock, to step down.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was CEO of AIG for less than three years, Hancock had lofty plans from the start of his time with the firm. One of these plans included returning $25 billion to shareholders through a combined effort of share buybacks and a consistent dividend stream for two years. This goal was ahead of schedule with returns of $13.1 billion to its shareholders by the end of 2016. Despite these efforts, after a couple of days of trading at a plunge of almost 9% prior to the Q4 results an at only 85% of AIG’s entire stated assets value, Hancock wasn’t the only one concerned about his position at AIG.\r\n\r\nIn times such as these for companies as large as AIG, it is easy to turn to the leadership as the main cause of such a crash. This of course is not always the case, but nevertheless, begins to make people question whether a change should be made to preserve the progress of the company. This was exactly the case for Hancock, claiming even without the full support of AIG’s shareholders, he felt it was both in his own self-interest and in the interest of the greater organization to not further undermine the growth of the firm. While the CEO succeeding Hancock will be the sixth in just 12 years for AIG, many investors and shareholders do agree that it is in fact the best solution for the organization as a whole. Carl Ichan, the fourth largest investor in AIG, stood fully behind this change of leadership.\r\n\r\nAs expected, shareholders are skeptical of a new leader’s ability to progress the company as needed. At the point, AIG’s goal is to decrease the volume of its balance sheet through several deals to shrink or sell parts of the company. Hancock himself had even had a combined 17 deals to shrink the company overall to just over $498 billion half of its value in 2007, when it took such a devastating blow following the recession. With almost a 5% stake in the company, Ichan frequently states his ideas for a more regulated supervision of the company, even if that means taking on more capital. In order to take all of these ideas and goals and put them into action, AIG must be diligent in who they choose to succeed Hancock.\r\n\r\nHancock has agreed to stay on until his successor is chosen, in hopes of avoiding any damage that can be dealt to its shareholders’ interests resulting from such uncertainty. Regardless of whom AIG chooses to fill the shoes of Hancock, the firm’s main priority will be to continue shedding assets and reducing risk in order to avoid repetition of the 2007-2008 crisis. Much is unknown, but one thing that is a definite for AIG is that these next few upcoming weeks will be crucial to the future of the company.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2017\/03\/09\/aig-ceo-peter-hancock-step-down-after-massive-loss-insurance-giant\/98946930\/\">http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2017\/03\/09\/aig-ceo-peter-hancock-step-down-after-massive-loss-insurance-giant\/98946930\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-aig-moves-ceo-idUSKBN16G1RB\">http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-aig-moves-ceo-idUSKBN16G1RB<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;",

In order to take all of these ideas and goals and put them into action, AIG must be diligent in who they choose to succeed Hancock.\r\n\r\nHancock has agreed to stay on until his successor is chosen, in hopes of avoiding any damage that can be dealt to its shareholders’ interests resulting from such uncertainty. Regardless of whom AIG chooses to fill the shoes of Hancock, the firm’s main priority will be to continue shedding assets and reducing risk in order to avoid repetition of the 2007-2008 crisis. Much is unknown, but one thing that is a definite for AIG is that these next few upcoming weeks will be crucial to the future of the company.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2017\/03\/09\/aig-ceo-peter-hancock-step-down-after-massive-loss-insurance-giant\/98946930\/\">http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2017\/03\/09\/aig-ceo-peter-hancock-step-down-after-massive-loss-insurance-giant\/98946930\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-aig-moves-ceo-idUSKBN16G1RB\">http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-aig-moves-ceo-idUSKBN16G1RB<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "Forecasters have predicted a more substantial amount of economic growth for the United States economy since the 2016 presidential election. While economists expected 2.2% economic growth in 2017 prior to the presidential election, they now expect 2.4% economic growth for the year. Similarly, prior to the election, economic growth for 2018 was expected to be 2.0% in contrast to predictions of 2.5% today.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Huffington-Post-Economic-growth.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-330 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Huffington-Post-Economic-growth-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: HuffingtonPost<\/p>\r\nMany of these improved economic growth predictions stem from the promises that President Trump has made to reduce business regulation, reform a tax code that businesses perceive as oppressive, and put a large infrastructure package into place.  These improved economic growth predictions for the next two years help explain the great performance of stock and bond markets.\r\n\r\nEconomists believe that a positive growth cycle could continue so long as optimism about the economy continues on its current path.\r\n\r\nHowever, economists expect growth to fall back to 2.1% in 2019 and thereafter. This expected rate of growth is similar to that which was expected prior to the 2016 presidential election.  It can be attributed to the different factors that fuel short-term and long-term growth.\r\n\r\nGrowth in infrastructure spending would put many people back to work for the time being, which would strengthen the economy, and an increase in the deficit would provide for more spending, which would strengthen the economy, but these are only temporary fixes. There are alternatives -- actual and substantial tax reform, simplifying regulation that helps companies operate more efficiently -- that would help give economists reason to believe there will be more growth in 2019 and beyond, but they feel uncertain about how much the current erratic presidential administration will actually be able to accomplish, and so they sit and wait to prognosticate as more is revealed.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/wsj-survey-of-economists-sees-growth-climbing-in-2017-and-2018-then-dissipating-1489672873\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/wsj-survey-of-economists-sees-growth-climbing-in-2017-and-2018-then-dissipating-1489672873<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;",

While the new tax proposal that would lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, arguably enticing businesses to return to the United States and repatriate profits from outside of the United States, has been hogging the most attention, Trump also announced a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood-lumber imports. The tariff is in response to a trade dispute with Canada that has lasted for decades, and the main issue is the Canadians government’s subsidies on its softwood-lumber industry. The tariff is just one example of Trump’s hardline approach on trade, and while Canada’s actions are considered violations of trade policy, the tariff will have a negative impact on the United States consumer.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Canadian-Lumber.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-345 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Canadian-Lumber-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: NPR<\/p>\r\nTariffs and protectionist policies negatively impact domestic consumers because they drive up domestic prices, and in this case they will affect the average consumer. Softwood lumber is typically used to build single-family homes. The tariff will not only eventually drive lumber costs up for U.S. customers by 6.4%, according to the National Association of Home Builders, but the anticipation of the lumber prices rising has already pushed them 22% higher since the start of 2017. Overall, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that the increase in price will total to $1,236 per each single-family home.\r\n\r\nThe tariff will drive up domestic home prices as well as negatively impact relations between Canada and the United States. This is a crucial time for favorable relations considering Canada, Mexico, and the United States will shortly be renegotiating NAFTA. This tariff will leave a sour taste on both sides of the border and will likely also cause retaliatory action. Negotiations between Canada and the United States would have led to a mutually-positive result, especially considering the two countries are close allies. Going into NAFTA negotiations will be more difficult after this hard-headed policy slap.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/24\/investing\/canada-lumber-tariff-trump\/<\/li>\r\n \t<li>http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/04\/25\/trumps-canadian-lumber-tariff-could-cost-us-homebuyers-about-1200.html<\/li>\r\n \t<li>https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dear-canada-its-not-personal-its-just-trade-1493234522<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Sales at its stores have fallen consistently for the past 10 quarters, and the company reported a $23.5 million loss (with revenue down 3%) for the fiscal year ended January 28th.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/J.-Crew.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-351\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/J.-Crew.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"262\" height=\"175\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Wall Street Journal<\/p>\r\nJ. Crew explained that it expects charges of around $10 million in its fiscal first quarter due to cut related expenses. However, the company foresees about $30 million of annual pretax savings as a result of these job cuts. J. Crew Chief Executive Millard Drexler said, “While challenging, we know what needs to be done and this is a critical step to position J. Crew for the future. We are committed to treating impacted associates with respect and support through this period of change.” Some of J. Crew’s long-term employees have already made the bold decision to leave the company in fear of job instability.\r\n\r\nEven though this is a difficult business decision to make, it is very rational. The online shopping trend has increased tremendously, and less people are visiting J. Crew’s retail stores each quarter. J. Crew needs to focus future prospects and securing its position  within the fashion world. For now, it needs to deal with its declining revenues and engage in some business restructuring.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/j-crew-plans-to-cut-250-jobs-1493129069\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/j-crew-plans-to-cut-250-jobs-1493129069<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/j-crew-to-cut-250-jobs-as-part-of-reorganization-2017-04-25\">http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/j-crew-to-cut-250-jobs-as-part-of-reorganization-2017-04-25<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

This current total of assets, excluding incurred liabilities, exceeds the amount of assets for some of the most renowned companies on the market, specifically WalMart, General Electric, and Proctor and Gamble. Additionally, Apple has gained much of these assets in the past four years at an exponential rate, with earnings exceeding $3.6 million per hour in the last quarter of 2016.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Apple-Cash.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-356 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Apple-Cash-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: WSJ<\/p>\r\nYou may ask, however, why would Apple have so much of this money at its disposal, and what would they hope to do with it? Along with many other large companies, Apple keeps most of its money offshore (93%) due to high tax rates in the United States. Under President Trump, and his initiative to bring U.S. companies back into the country, he has proposed a day of reduced taxes on these companies in an attempt to encourage them to move back to the U.S. This would allow Apple to utilize its resources here by marketing to more shareholders or being able to be more active in acquisitions.\r\n\r\nBecause of these political prospects, and the fact that Warren Buffet’s share in Apple has doubled in the past year, the Apple stock is soaring. These factors have driven Apple’s stock up and have made it a possibility that Apple will soon have a larger dividend yield in the future.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of Trump’s proposed policies have been controversial, it seems to me that his desire to bring U.S. companies back into the U.S. would be a beneficial one.

    "post_content": "Eileen Barros\r\n\r\nOctober 28, 2017\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago it was announced that Time Warner and AT&amp;T would merge, with AT&amp;T to buy Time Warner at $85.4 billion. The deadline to close the proposed deal was Monday October 22th, but AT&amp;T submitted a request to the SEC to extend its deadline to an unspecified date. AT&amp;T has struggled with obtaining the required regulatory approvals for the deal because political parties and the public are concerned about the deal and would disapprove of it. If the deal fell through, the AT&amp;T investors would have gotten tricked this Halloween. However, Time Warner third quarter results are closing and investors may be in for a treat in the future if the deal closes. Time Warner has performed well, even at the verge of the deal closing.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_376\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/161021113412-att-timewarner-780x439.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-376\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/161021113412-att-timewarner-780x439-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a> Source: CNNMoney[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe deal has certainly startled the public because the merger would put together the largest satellite TV provider in the country, the second largest mobile carrier, and a large number of cable networks, including HBO, TBS,TNT, CNN , HLN. Most likely, investors have started to buy stocks at Time Warner to get a premium if the deal closes. The status of the deal has been holding investors in suspense, because people fear that AT&amp;T would incur losses just like they did with Direct TV.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, AT&amp;T's forecast may not gone as expected because there were new alternatives to their TV service. Even if the deal goes through, the performance of AT&amp;T is still uncertain because it is facing many competitors such as Netflix and HULU.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/gadfly\/articles\/2017-10-26\/time-warner-earnings-looks-good-for-at-t-investors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/gadfly\/articles\/2017-10-26\/time-warner-earnings-looks-good-for-at-t-investors<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/consumerist.com\/2017\/10\/24\/att-and-time-warner-extend-deadline-for-85-4b-merger-promise-its-still-happening\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/consumerist.com\/2017\/10\/24\/att-and-time-warner-extend-deadline-for-85-4b-merger-promise-its-still-happening\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Katherine Dorovitsine\r\n\r\nNovember 10, 2017\r\n\r\nOn September 12th, Apple grabbed the attention of millions of eager viewers during its special event at the Steve Jobs Theater. New models of the Apple TV, Watch and iPhone were met with the usual excitement from loyal customers, and the latest iOS update promised to make iPhone and iPad “the most powerful, personal, and intelligent devices they’ve ever been.” Users were greeted with one more improvement in Apple’s line of products which stood out among the rest, though; boldly introducing the iPhone X as a vision to the future, Apple once again brought itself to the forefront of innovative technology. The new model features an all-screen design, the most sophisticated camera yet with face ID technology, a more durable and water-resistant shell, and countless other upgrades from what seems like the now outdated iPhone 7.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_459\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/iphonexdesign.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-459\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/iphonexdesign-300x251.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" \/><\/a> Source: Macrumors.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nConcerns over the new iPhone’s large price tag, starting at $999 and increasing with storage size, were settled within 3 days of its release in stores. 20 major cities had already sold out and online shipments were delayed, estimated to arrive as late as December. Apple’s clear success in the release of the newest iPhone model became apparent in its stock price as well, pushing it to a new record of $174.25. The newest iPhone release is also expected to have effects that span beyond the borders of Apple itself. Sales during the holiday season are expected to decrease drastically as a result of the high price tag of Apple’s newest, in-demand products. Morgan Stanley analysts have estimated more than $52 billion of spending will be deferred from other retail products this holiday season, as a result of Apple’s new releases.\r\n\r\nWhile Apple’s employees and shareholders are benefitting from its growth, what does it mean for competitors? Apple and Samsung have been in constant competition for years, with one company’s newest smartphone always working to “one-up” the other. Has the iPhone X placed itself ahead of its competitor indefinitely? Or will it fuel the competition as Samsung prepares to release its newest Galaxy? While it’s unclear whether one company will finally dominate the other in the near future, we can be sure that smartphone technology will continue to provide users with huge advancements. The iPhone X is likely just the beginning of a new age of digital reliance. Apple’s advertisements seem to be right in that it’s time to “say hello to the future.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-events\/september-2017\/\">https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-events\/september-2017\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/talkingtech\/2017\/11\/05\/apple-iphone-x-sells-out-20-big-cities\/833736001\/\">https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/talkingtech\/2017\/11\/05\/apple-iphone-x-sells-out-20-big-cities\/833736001\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/apple-iphone-x-stock-price-could-limit-holiday-spending-in-other-categories-morgan-stanley-says-2017-11-1006466126\">http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/apple-iphone-x-stock-price-could-limit-holiday-spending-in-other-categories-morgan-stanley-says-2017-11-1006466126<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Even if the deal goes through, the performance of AT&amp;T is still uncertain because it is facing many competitors such as Netflix and HULU.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/gadfly\/articles\/2017-10-26\/time-warner-earnings-looks-good-for-at-t-investors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/gadfly\/articles\/2017-10-26\/time-warner-earnings-looks-good-for-at-t-investors<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/consumerist.com\/2017\/10\/24\/att-and-time-warner-extend-deadline-for-85-4b-merger-promise-its-still-happening\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/consumerist.com\/2017\/10\/24\/att-and-time-warner-extend-deadline-for-85-4b-merger-promise-its-still-happening\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Statistics from the Federal Reserve have indicated that American households are billions of dollars deeper in debt compared to the figures just one year ago. According to the monthly International Monetary Fund report, the median household debt-to-GDP ratio has risen from 52% to 62% in the years 2008 to 2016 (consumer debt currently equals two thirds of America's GDP). This ratio has also risen in emerging economies around the world, so America is not alone in this problem. The steep incline in consumer debt is particularly alarming because personal loans must be paid back in a timely fashion, whereas government debt is ongoing.

However, short term economic growth and increasing consumer debt go hand-in-hand; a more financially stable economy is paired with lower growth and higher unemployment. Americans heavily rely on auto loans, college loans, and mortgages to finance their lives, and would be unable to live at the standard they would like without them. Programs need to help families rely less on external financing, which involves loans with extremely high interest rates that exceed the same increase in income over time. If contractionary monetary or fiscal policy is implemented to help stabilize the economy, such as a higher reserve requirement or increased taxation, Americans will have less opportunity to spend, and consumer debt levels will continue to rise.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/consumer-debt-statistics-causes-and-impact-3305704\">www.thebalance.com\/consumer-debt-statistics-causes-and-impact-3305704<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/americans-are-more-indebted-than-ever-raising-economic-risk\">www.businessinsider.com\/americans-are-more-indebted-than-ever-raising-economic-risk<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/GFSR\/Issues\/2017\/09\/27\/global-financial-stability-report-october-2017\">http:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/GFSR\/Issues\/2017\/09\/27\/global-financial-stability-report-october-2017<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

If contractionary monetary or fiscal policy is implemented to help stabilize the economy, such as a higher reserve requirement or increased taxation, Americans will have less opportunity to spend, and consumer debt levels will continue to rise.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/consumer-debt-statistics-causes-and-impact-3305704\">www.thebalance.com\/consumer-debt-statistics-causes-and-impact-3305704<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/americans-are-more-indebted-than-ever-raising-economic-risk\">www.businessinsider.com\/americans-are-more-indebted-than-ever-raising-economic-risk<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/GFSR\/Issues\/2017\/09\/27\/global-financial-stability-report-october-2017\">http:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/GFSR\/Issues\/2017\/09\/27\/global-financial-stability-report-october-2017<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Currently, the tech giant's only headquarters is located in Seattle, Washington. But due to the company’s fast-growing nature, executives are unsure how much Seattle will be able to handle in the near future. Cities such as Chicago, Dallas, and San Diego immediately started showing interest in this new project.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_401\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/amazonHQ2_iStock-186827106.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-401\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/amazonHQ2_iStock-186827106-300x172.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"172\" \/><\/a> Source: Seattle Business Magazine[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAmazon has laid out its criteria for its project, which is called HQ2. The company would like their new headquarters to be located in a welcoming, metropolitan city with more than one million residents, have on-site access to mass transit, a quick commute to an international airport, and easy access to a main highway or road. They are also looking for a location that is diverse and has many recreational opportunities. Currently, Dallas and Chicago have been showing the most interest in becoming the new location. Dallas representatives have started to contact Amazon regarding the next steps of the project and think this new addition will be highly beneficial to their fast-growing economy and community. In addition, Chicago fits all of Amazon’s criteria and is an urban setting with an established culture.\r\n\r\nAccording to the New York Times, “Amazon is one of the largest tech employers in the world. But the company said the total number of new employees at its second headquarters outside Seattle could reach 50,000.” This new project would stimulate the economy because of the job opportunities it offers. However, it would have a much stronger impact in a smaller city than in a very large one. While the expansion has its benefits, these cities must also anticipate some drawbacks, including rising housing costs, bad traffic gridlock, and an increased gap between the middle class and lower class. Overall, the city that will house the new headquarters will benefit the most, because the positives certainly outweigh the negatives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kurtbadenhausen\/2017\/10\/24\/where-should-amazon-locate-their-new-headquarter-three-experts-weigh-in\/#69a7f08441da\">www.forbes.com\/sites\/kurtbadenhausen\/2017\/10\/24\/where-should-amazon-locate-their-new-headquarter-three-experts-weigh-in\/#69a7f08441da<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/09\/07\/technology\/amazon-headquarters-north-america.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/09\/07\/technology\/amazon-headquarters-north-america.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/wqad.com\/2017\/10\/27\/the-city-amazon-picks-for-its-second-headquarters-will-change-forever\">wqad.com\/2017\/10\/27\/the-city-amazon-picks-for-its-second-headquarters-will-change-forever<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Zill Ratanji\r\n\r\nFebruary 18, 2018\r\n\r\nThis year's flu season has been absolutely brutal. Not only has it been affecting health care clinics, but also businesses nationwide. More employees taking off from work leads to more production being faltered, causing a standstill in the overall economy. Moreover, for small businesses, this effect can cause their whole work force to go missing, leaving no one to operate the business. To put this effect into perspective, “the total cost to employers could be $15.4 billion in lost productivity, or output…such a toll theoretically could cut first-quarter economic growth by three-tenths to four tenths of a percentage point, from a projected 2.6% annual rate to 2.2% or 2.3%” (Davidson). This shows how the effects of the flu spread far greater than just the medical field.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_501\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/shutterstock_126288149.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-501\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/shutterstock_126288149-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Source: Benzinga[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDue to these circumstances, businesses are considering giving their workers free flu shots to avoid such an epidemic to their firm. Although it may not guarantee a perfect success rate, it will be a great path towards prevention. Other businesses are even considering giving their employees paid sick leave. This will incentivize sick employees to stay home and avoid risking other employees from getting sick as well. “A recent study out of Florida Atlantic University found that, unsurprisingly, US workers without paid sick leave are more likely than those with paid sick leave to keep going to work when they’re ill” (Gillett). Therefore, businesses should reconsider their health care policies and procedures to prevent their businesses from entirely shutting down in cases of such an outbreak.\r\n\r\nBusinesses face losses that are employee related, but customer related too. Restaurants and other service organizations experience a great loss of customers because people are less willing to go out to eat and shop because of the flu. All in all, businesses have been suffering a great deal from this flu internally and externally.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2018\/02\/13\/nasty-flu-season-takes-toll-small-businesses\/321785002\/.\">www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2018\/02\/13\/nasty-flu-season-takes-toll-small-businesses\/321785002\/.<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/2018-flu-season-will-cost-employers-billions-2018-1\">www.businessinsider.com\/2018-flu-season-will-cost-employers-billions-2018-1<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "<div>Recently, there has been much controversy about Trump's new tax reform. Upon his presidency, Trump has declared the Unified Tax Reform Framework on September 27, 2017. This new tax reform would reduce the income tax rates and lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. It is stated that the Trump administration wants to boost the money supply and have more revenue flowing through the economy. According to Fox News, \"cutting corporate rates could also increase the average American household income by $4,000 annually.\" People will have more money to spend on goods and services, which will boost the economy.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_413\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/donald-trump-tax-plan.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-413\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/donald-trump-tax-plan-300x137.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"137\" \/><\/a> Source: Keloland.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>On the other hand, some people assert that Trump's tax reform plan would merely benefit the rich corporations and have minimal impact on the poor or middle classes. For example, the poorest fifth of the population would see their current tax break of 0.5 percent drop to 0.2 percent. The Balance claims this tax plan \"eliminates itemized deductions except for those on charitable contributions, mortgage interest, property taxes, and retirement savings.\" The Tax Policy Center said that the Framework would increase the $20 trillion national debt by $7 trillion over the next ten years. The plan eliminates state and local tax deductions, which means the taxpayers in states with high taxes such as California and New York will not benefit from this new tax plan. The Framework also eliminates personal exemptions. The personal exemption allows taxpayers to subtract $4,050 from income for each person claimed on the tax return, mainly children known as dependent to the family. Families with many children would pay still higher taxes because the children are not held accountable anymore.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>This plan has sparked some very contentious debates.

    "post_content": "Sherry Chen\r\n\r\nOctober 30, 2017\r\n\r\nRecently, there has been much controversy about Trump's new tax reform. Upon his presidency, Trump has declared the Unified Tax Reform Framework on September 27, 2017. This new tax reform would reduce the income tax rates and lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. It is stated that the Trump administration wants to boost the money supply and have more revenue flowing through the economy. According to Fox News, \"cutting corporate rates could also increase the average American household income by $4,000 annually.\" People will have more money to spend on goods and services, which will boost the economy.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_413\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/donald-trump-tax-plan.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-413\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/donald-trump-tax-plan-300x137.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"137\" \/><\/a> Source: Keloland.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people assert that Trump's tax reform plan would merely benefit rich corporations and have minimal impact on the poor or middle classes. For example, the poorest fifth of the population would see their current tax break of 0.5 percent drop to 0.2 percent. The Balance claims this tax plan \"eliminates itemized deductions except for those on charitable contributions, mortgage interest, property taxes, and retirement savings.\" The Tax Policy Center said that the Framework would increase the $20 trillion national debt by $7 trillion over the next ten years. The plan eliminates state and local tax deductions, which means the taxpayers in states with high taxes such as California and New York will not benefit from this new tax plan. The Framework also eliminates personal exemptions. The personal exemption allows taxpayers to subtract $4,050 from income for each person claimed on the tax return, mainly children known as dependent to the family. This means families with many children would pay higher taxes.\r\n\r\nSo far, his plan has sparked some very contentious debates. It will be interesting to see how it moves through Congress in the upcoming weeks.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/trump-s-tax-plan-how-it-affects-you-4113968\">https:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/trump-s-tax-plan-how-it-affects-you-4113968<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2017\/10\/30\/democratic-women-in-senate-were-all-for-these-tax-reform-principles-until-trump-proposed-them.html\">http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2017\/10\/30\/democratic-women-in-senate-were-all-for-these-tax-reform-principles-until-trump-proposed-them.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Amazon has done this so many times that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s visionary founder, might as well run a master class on the subject. By focusing on customer experience above all else, the tech giant continues to find new business opportunities in various different fields. Right now, the business empire has its sights set on the pharmaceutical industry.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_442\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/amazondrugs2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-442\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/amazondrugs2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a> Source: PYMNTS.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAccording to reports made by CNBC, Amazon is currently hiring a general manager to lead a team to discover how to break into this business. As of April, Japan Times reported that Amazon has expanded its Prime Now service to deliver drugs. Amazon has a history of testing new product lines in foreign countries, and the Japanese version of Amazon's website includes pharmaceuticals as a shopping category.

    "post_content": "Mark Kashani\r\n\r\nNovember 4, 2017\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, October 25th, Sprint (S) reported a narrower quarterly loss than expected; the company declined to host a post-earnings conference call among speculation of a merger with T-Mobile (TMUS). T-Mobile and Sprint had planned to meet with their boards of directors to create a merger between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers. Both companies were expected to announce the agreement within the first half of November. Their goal was to create a company with more than 130 million subscribers, just behind Verizon Communications (VZ).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_449\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ap_resize.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-449\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ap_resize-300x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> Source: Android Police[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, October 30th, shares of Sprint and T-Mobile took a tumble midday after reports that their merger may be coming to an end. More specifically, Sprint’s stock fell around 11% and T-Mobile was down around 5%. Supposedly, SoftBank (SFTBF), a Japanese company with a majority stake in Sprint, called off negotiations due to concerns regarding the ownership structure of the newly combined business.\r\n\r\nThere were disagreements as to which side should have more control over the combined company,  but on November 2nd, T-Mobile presented Sprint with a revised offer. T-Mobile CEO John Legere made it clear that he did not want the merger to collapse. I initially believed that Sprint and T-Mobile would eventually come to a mutual agreement to merge and remain more competitive. However, on November 4th, both companies announced that they have ceased discussions regarding the merger.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/25\/sprint-stock-earnings-tmobile\/\">http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/25\/sprint-stock-earnings-tmobile\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Business\/Deals\/SoftBank-calling-off-talks-to-merge-Sprint-T-Mobile\">https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Business\/Deals\/SoftBank-calling-off-talks-to-merge-Sprint-T-Mobile<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/30\/technology\/business\/sprint-t-mobile-merger\/index.html\">http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/30\/technology\/business\/sprint-t-mobile-merger\/index.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/11\/2\/16600358\/tmobile-sprint-restart-merger-talks\">https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/11\/2\/16600358\/tmobile-sprint-restart-merger-talks<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2017\/11\/04\/562117602\/potential-t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-falls-apart\">http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2017\/11\/04\/562117602\/potential-t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-falls-apart<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Mark Kashani\r\n\r\nNovember 4, 2017\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, October 25th, Sprint (S) reported a narrower quarterly loss than expected; the company declined to host a post-earnings conference call among speculation of a merger with T-Mobile (TMUS). T-Mobile and Sprint had planned to meet with their boards of directors to create a merger between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers. Both companies were expected to announce the agreement within the first half of November. Their goal was to create a company with more than 130 million subscribers, just behind Verizon Communications (VZ).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_449\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ap_resize.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-449\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ap_resize-300x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> Source: Android Police[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, October 30th, shares of Sprint and T-Mobile took a tumble midday after reports that their merger may be coming to an end. More specifically, Sprint’s stock fell around 11% and T-Mobile was down around 5%. Supposedly, SoftBank (SFTBF), a Japanese company with a majority stake in Sprint, called off negotiations due to concerns regarding the ownership structure of the newly combined business.\r\n\r\nThere were disagreements as to which side should have more control over the combined company,  but on November 2nd, T-Mobile presented Sprint with a revised offer. T-Mobile CEO John Legere made it clear that he did not want the merger to collapse. I initially believed that Sprint and T-Mobile would eventually come to a mutual agreement to merge and remain more competitive. However, on November 4th, both companies announced that they have ceased discussions regarding the merger.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/25\/sprint-stock-earnings-tmobile\/\">http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/10\/25\/sprint-stock-earnings-tmobile\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Business\/Deals\/SoftBank-calling-off-talks-to-merge-Sprint-T-Mobile\">https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Business\/Deals\/SoftBank-calling-off-talks-to-merge-Sprint-T-Mobile<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/30\/technology\/business\/sprint-t-mobile-merger\/index.html\">http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/30\/technology\/business\/sprint-t-mobile-merger\/index.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/11\/2\/16600358\/tmobile-sprint-restart-merger-talks\">https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/11\/2\/16600358\/tmobile-sprint-restart-merger-talks<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2017\/11\/04\/562117602\/potential-t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-falls-apart\">http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2017\/11\/04\/562117602\/potential-t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-falls-apart<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "John Park\r\n\r\nDecember 5, 2017\r\n\r\nFounder Steve Ells will step down as Chief Executive Officer of Chipotle after 24 years of selling the company's organic, freshly-prepared burritos, bowls, and salads. He has failed to keep pushing the boundaries, as several mainstream chains, including McDonald’s and Wendy’s, have also switched to fresh ingredients. Furthermore, Chipotle has failed to recover from its drop in customer traffic and share value ever since the fall of 2015, when an E.coli outbreak affected various Pacific Northwest restaurants. Mr. Ells has acknowledged he disregarded customer service as he tackled E.coli, salmonella, and other norovirus outbreaks.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_488\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/chipotle_sign1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-488\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/chipotle_sign1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a> Source: Denverpost.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nChipotle’s innovation, dubbed “fast-casual,” is an upgrade from fast food without the table-service of a sit-down restaurant. However, it has now become a common category of dining chains. Ells put it best when he said, “It is clear that we need to move faster to make improvements.” He has voluntarily stepped down, and will move into the role of Chipotle’s executive chairman focusing on innovation. Chipotle’s shares went up 3.2% soon after Ells’ new role was announced. Sanford Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said, “He has long been viewed as the culinary and cultural standard-bearer for the company, but less focused on operations.”\r\n\r\nWith new leadership on Chipotle’s horizon, change is inevitable. “There would be a realignment of the performance pay,” according to Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott, “Ells’ stock package is one of the highest on the street.” The new CEO will be paid a salary reflective of Chipotle’s performance in contrast from Ells’ $15.7 million, which included salary, stock, and option awards. Under new leadership, many expect Chipotle to utilize customer-loyalty programs that Mr. Ells abhorred, but that other chains like Starbucks have instituted profitably. Chipotle has undergone many recent changes even before the announcement, like the restaurant’s morphing online order and pickup service, and so, it is exciting to see what Chipotle has in store for us next.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/chipotle-founder-to-step-down-as-ceo-1511962551\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/chipotle-founder-to-step-down-as-ceo-1511962551<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/11\/29\/chipotle-founder-steve-ells-stepping-down-as-ceo\/\"> https:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/11\/29\/chipotle-founder-steve-ells-stepping-down-as-ceo\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Jun Huang\r\n\r\nNovember 11, 2017\r\n\r\nAfter almost twenty years of rivalry, two of the largest electronics manufacturers, Intel and AMD, will collaborate on their first solution for high performance laptop chips. Their goal is to combine AMD Radeon graphics processing units (GPU) with Intel central processing units (CPU) using the Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EBIM) technology. What sets this new innovation apart from previous generation laptops is the weight, size, and power consumption of the final product. Intel claims that compared to traditional laptops, a laptop with EBIM has a reduced thickness of up to 15mm in height. Additionally, power consumption will be drastically improved, resulting in a reduction of up to 50%. This technology allows Intel and AMD to bring a longer and more portable gaming experience to the consumer without compromising performance.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_464\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/79e1b78369e0a6765ba6ef861dbfec19_XL.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-464\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/79e1b78369e0a6765ba6ef861dbfec19_XL-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Source: Fudzilla[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe pricing of this new technology has not been announced yet, but seeing the recurring trend of Intel’s pricing with their desktop processors, this innovation will certainly come with a heftier price tag. In the long run, however, this new technology is beneficial to the consumer in many ways. One, of course, is the innovative aspect of this collaboration. For the past few years Intel has shown little to no innovations within the gaming community. According to a performance benchmark conducted by HardwareCanucks, the i7 2600k, a Sandy Bridge 32 nanometer architecture CPU released in January 2011, has a negligible performance difference compared to a more recent model, the i7 7800k, which was released in October 2017. Although this is the desktop CPU situation, it is actually accurately representative of the mobile gaming technology Intel is bringing to the gaming community. Hopefully, their collaboration with AMD is an indication of gaming innovation.\r\n\r\nWhile initial prices are expected to be higher for this new technology, this certainly brings attention to Nvidia, an even bigger oligopoly of the gaming industry. As of Q1 2017, Nvidia dominates 72.5% of the discrete GPU market, with AMD as its only significant competitor. Intel’s attempt to join forces with AMD is not only an effort to take down the GPU supergiant, but also their introduction into the GPU market. As such, we can expect to see the disruption in the market shares bringing more competition, ultimately resulting in lower prices and more innovation for the consumer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hardwarecanucks.com\/forum\/hardware-canucks-reviews\/76333-i7-2600k-vs-i7-8700k-upgrading-worthwhile-15.html\"> http:\/\/www.hardwarecanucks.com\/forum\/hardware-canucks-reviews\/76333-i7-2600k-vs-i7-8700k-upgrading-worthwhile-15.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.intel.com\/editorials\/new-intel-core-processor-combine-high-performance-cpu-discrete-graphics-sleek-thin-devices\/\">https:\/\/newsroom.intel.com\/editorials\/new-intel-core-processor-combine-high-performance-cpu-discrete-graphics-sleek-thin-devices\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamersnexus.net\/industry\/3114-intel-amd-collaborate-on-mobile-products-with-emib\">https:\/\/www.gamersnexus.net\/industry\/3114-intel-amd-collaborate-on-mobile-products-with-emib<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jonpeddie.com\/press-releases\/add-in-board-market-decreased-in-q117-from-last-quarter-with-nvidia-gaining\/\">https:\/\/www.jonpeddie.com\/press-releases\/add-in-board-market-decreased-in-q117-from-last-quarter-with-nvidia-gaining\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Jun Huang\r\n\r\nNovember 11, 2017\r\n\r\nAfter almost twenty years of rivalry, two of the largest electronics manufacturers, Intel and AMD, will collaborate on their first solution for high performance laptop chips. Their goal is to combine AMD Radeon graphics processing units (GPU) with Intel central processing units (CPU) using the Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EBIM) technology. What sets this new innovation apart from previous generation laptops is the weight, size, and power consumption of the final product. Intel claims that compared to traditional laptops, a laptop with EBIM has a reduced thickness of up to 15mm in height. Additionally, power consumption will be drastically improved, resulting in a reduction of up to 50%. This technology allows Intel and AMD to bring a longer and more portable gaming experience to the consumer without compromising performance.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_464\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/79e1b78369e0a6765ba6ef861dbfec19_XL.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-464\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/79e1b78369e0a6765ba6ef861dbfec19_XL-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Source: Fudzilla[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe pricing of this new technology has not been announced yet, but seeing the recurring trend of Intel’s pricing with their desktop processors, this innovation will certainly come with a heftier price tag. In the long run, however, this new technology is beneficial to the consumer in many ways. One, of course, is the innovative aspect of this collaboration. For the past few years Intel has shown little to no innovations within the gaming community. According to a performance benchmark conducted by HardwareCanucks, the i7 2600k, a Sandy Bridge 32 nanometer architecture CPU released in January 2011, has a negligible performance difference compared to a more recent model, the i7 7800k, which was released in October 2017. Although this is the desktop CPU situation, it is actually accurately representative of the mobile gaming technology Intel is bringing to the gaming community. Hopefully, their collaboration with AMD is an indication of gaming innovation.\r\n\r\nWhile initial prices are expected to be higher for this new technology, this certainly brings attention to Nvidia, an even bigger oligopoly of the gaming industry. As of Q1 2017, Nvidia dominates 72.5% of the discrete GPU market, with AMD as its only significant competitor. Intel’s attempt to join forces with AMD is not only an effort to take down the GPU supergiant, but also their introduction into the GPU market. As such, we can expect to see the disruption in the market shares bringing more competition, ultimately resulting in lower prices and more innovation for the consumer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hardwarecanucks.com\/forum\/hardware-canucks-reviews\/76333-i7-2600k-vs-i7-8700k-upgrading-worthwhile-15.html\"> http:\/\/www.hardwarecanucks.com\/forum\/hardware-canucks-reviews\/76333-i7-2600k-vs-i7-8700k-upgrading-worthwhile-15.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.intel.com\/editorials\/new-intel-core-processor-combine-high-performance-cpu-discrete-graphics-sleek-thin-devices\/\">https:\/\/newsroom.intel.com\/editorials\/new-intel-core-processor-combine-high-performance-cpu-discrete-graphics-sleek-thin-devices\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamersnexus.net\/industry\/3114-intel-amd-collaborate-on-mobile-products-with-emib\">https:\/\/www.gamersnexus.net\/industry\/3114-intel-amd-collaborate-on-mobile-products-with-emib<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jonpeddie.com\/press-releases\/add-in-board-market-decreased-in-q117-from-last-quarter-with-nvidia-gaining\/\">https:\/\/www.jonpeddie.com\/press-releases\/add-in-board-market-decreased-in-q117-from-last-quarter-with-nvidia-gaining\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

According to a Deloitte survey of about 5000 Americans, shoppers are projected to spend 51% of their holiday budget online, compared to 42% in stores. This will be the first time that online holiday shopping is expected to beat out in-store sales.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_468\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/online-shopping.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-468\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/online-shopping-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" \/><\/a> Source: Odyssey[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, only 28% of people expect to shop in traditional department stores, which is a decrease of 4% from last year. A larger percentage of people internet shopping is causing companies to focus on their online businesses. This can be seen through Macy’s holiday hiring; they recently decreased their total amount of seasonal workers, but increased the number of workers that will be assisting with online orders by 3000 people. Target is also hopping on the internet trend. They recently launched Gift Now, a service which allows customers to send gifts via email.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Deloitte, Adobe is predicting an increase in online shopping. They expect online sales will reach $107.4 billion dollars, which is an increase of 13.8% compared to last year. A great part of this will be due to Cyber Monday, which is predicted to be the largest online shopping day with $6.6 billion dollars in online sales, a 16.5% increase from last year. According to Adobe, Thanksgiving is also expected to see an increase of sales by 15%. This prediction is interesting given that the National Retail Association anticipated that 99 million people said they will shop in-store during Thanksgiving weekend, a decrease of 3 million from last year. <\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/02\/mobile-holiday-shopping-visits-in-u-s-will-surpass-desktop-for-first-time\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/02\/mobile-holiday-shopping-visits-in-u-s-will-surpass-desktop-for-first-time\/<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/online-will-exceed-in-store-sales-for-first-time-holiday-2017-10\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/online-will-exceed-in-store-sales-for-first-time-holiday-2017-10<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-macy-s-employment\/macys-to-hire-80000-workers-for-holidays-fewer-than-last-year-idUSKCN1BP36T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-macy-s-employment\/macys-to-hire-80000-workers-for-holidays-fewer-than-last-year-idUSKCN1BP36T<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tbo.com\/news\/business\/retail\/online-spending-to-surpass-in-store-for-the-first-time-this-holiday\/2342490\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.tbo.com\/news\/business\/retail\/online-spending-to-surpass-in-store-for-the-first-time-this-holiday\/2342490<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/deloitte-study-happy-holidays-on-the-way-without-the-ribbons-and-bows-300541856.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/deloitte-study-happy-holidays-on-the-way-without-the-ribbons-and-bows-300541856.html<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

This prediction is interesting given that the National Retail Association anticipated that 99 million people said they will shop in-store during Thanksgiving weekend, a decrease of 3 million from last year. <\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/02\/mobile-holiday-shopping-visits-in-u-s-will-surpass-desktop-for-first-time\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/02\/mobile-holiday-shopping-visits-in-u-s-will-surpass-desktop-for-first-time\/<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/online-will-exceed-in-store-sales-for-first-time-holiday-2017-10\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/online-will-exceed-in-store-sales-for-first-time-holiday-2017-10<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-macy-s-employment\/macys-to-hire-80000-workers-for-holidays-fewer-than-last-year-idUSKCN1BP36T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-macy-s-employment\/macys-to-hire-80000-workers-for-holidays-fewer-than-last-year-idUSKCN1BP36T<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tbo.com\/news\/business\/retail\/online-spending-to-surpass-in-store-for-the-first-time-this-holiday\/2342490\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.tbo.com\/news\/business\/retail\/online-spending-to-surpass-in-store-for-the-first-time-this-holiday\/2342490<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/deloitte-study-happy-holidays-on-the-way-without-the-ribbons-and-bows-300541856.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/deloitte-study-happy-holidays-on-the-way-without-the-ribbons-and-bows-300541856.html<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

A larger percentage of people internet shopping is causing companies to focus on their online businesses. This can be seen through Macy’s holiday hiring; they recently decreased their total amount of seasonal workers, but increased the number of workers that will be assisting with online orders by 3000 people. Target is also hopping on the internet trend. They recently launched Gift Now, a service which allows customers to send gifts via email.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Deloitte, Adobe is predicting an increase in online shopping. They expect online sales will reach $107.4 billion dollars, which is an increase of 13.8% compared to last year. A great part of this will be due to Cyber Monday, which is predicted to be the largest online shopping day with $6.6 billion dollars in online sales, a 16.5% increase from last year. According to Adobe, Thanksgiving is also expected to see an increase of sales by 15%. This prediction is interesting given that the National Retail Association anticipated that 99 million people said they will shop in-store during Thanksgiving weekend, a decrease of 3 million from last year. <\/span>\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/02\/mobile-holiday-shopping-visits-in-u-s-will-surpass-desktop-for-first-time\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/02\/mobile-holiday-shopping-visits-in-u-s-will-surpass-desktop-for-first-time\/<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/online-will-exceed-in-store-sales-for-first-time-holiday-2017-10\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/online-will-exceed-in-store-sales-for-first-time-holiday-2017-10<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-macy-s-employment\/macys-to-hire-80000-workers-for-holidays-fewer-than-last-year-idUSKCN1BP36T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-macy-s-employment\/macys-to-hire-80000-workers-for-holidays-fewer-than-last-year-idUSKCN1BP36T<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tbo.com\/news\/business\/retail\/online-spending-to-surpass-in-store-for-the-first-time-this-holiday\/2342490\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.tbo.com\/news\/business\/retail\/online-spending-to-surpass-in-store-for-the-first-time-this-holiday\/2342490<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/deloitte-study-happy-holidays-on-the-way-without-the-ribbons-and-bows-300541856.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/deloitte-study-happy-holidays-on-the-way-without-the-ribbons-and-bows-300541856.html<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

But from a contrarian point of view, they have been doing a lot right and will figure out ways to reduce their high costs and boost user growth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/11\/07\/technology\/snap-earnings.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/11\/07\/technology\/snap-earnings.html <\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/chrissniderdesign.com\/blog\/resources\/social-media-statistics\/\">https:\/\/chrissniderdesign.com\/blog\/resources\/social-media-statistics\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/07\/technology\/business\/snapchat-earnings\/index.html\">http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/07\/technology\/business\/snapchat-earnings\/index.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Jun Huang\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 2018\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, cryptocurrency has faced exponential rates of growth. The most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached an all time high of $20,000 in December 2017. Investors who purchased Bitcoin when the prices were in the thousands expected further potential from it. Some even say that prices will continue to skyrocket as cryptocurrency becomes more widely traded and accepted. <\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_522\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Goldman-Sachs-Considers-Launching-Cryptocurrency-Trading-Operation-1024x512-10-02-2017.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-522\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Goldman-Sachs-Considers-Launching-Cryptocurrency-Trading-Operation-1024x512-10-02-2017-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> Source: ETHNews.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On December 18th, 2017, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other major cryptocurrencies began plummeting. By the end of December, prices dropped by nearly 40%. It continued to plummet until it reached $7000 per Bitcoin, which is roughly a 65% drop from the all time high. The major reason for this crash was the concern towards regulatory crackdown in Asia. According to Business Insider, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that  \"legislative regulation [for bitcoin] will be definitely required in future.\" In addition, Chinese officials announced their plans to restrict access for major cryptocurrency platforms. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from stricter regulations, cryptocurrency possesses many inherent risks. Its greatest strength and weakness lies in the decentralized market. Without government control or regulation, both buyers and sellers are fully anonymous. However, the lack of regulation can also pose many threats. Without proper regulation and safety systems implemented, hackers can easily reroute the address of the recipients to their own wallet and receive those funds. Goldman Sachs, a multinational investment banking company, has recently noted the security flaws of the blockchain technology. They mentioned that they will be compliant towards their clients, but will be mindful that they “may be vulnerable to cyber attacks”. Another concern Goldman hinted at was how “nascent” the blockchain technology is. Governments across the globe are still deciding whether they need stricter regulations on cryptocurrency. Some have already announced stricter regulations, which can mean that cryptocurrency is potentially dangerous for Goldman Sachs. Additionally, there aren’t many places that accept cryptocurrency. Whether cryptocurrency will become the future is still up for debate. Despite these claims and concerns from Goldman, there has been little to no price drops in the markets. In fact, Bitcoin prices have increased by around 10% since the announcement. <\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindaily.co\/2018\/02\/27\/goldman-sachs-cites-risk-of-crypto-after-acquiring-crypto-exchange\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.coindaily.co\/2018\/02\/27\/goldman-sachs-cites-risk-of-crypto-after-acquiring-crypto-exchange\/<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-market-crash-explained-causes-2018-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-market-crash-explained-causes-2018-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/2017\/12\/19\/bitcoin-exchange-collapses-second-cyber-attack-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/2017\/12\/19\/bitcoin-exchange-collapses-second-cyber-attack-year\/<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;",

Furthermore, Chipotle has failed to recover from its drop in customer traffic and share value ever since the fall of 2015, when an E.coli outbreak affected various Pacific Northwest regions.

Under new leadership, many expect Chipotle to utilize customer-loyalty programs that Mr. Ells abhorred, but that other chains like Starbucks have instituted profitably. Chipotle has undergone many recent changes even before the announcement, like the restaurant’s morphing online order and pickup service, and so, it is exciting to see what Chipotle has in store for us next.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/chipotle-founder-to-step-down-as-ceo-1511962551\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/chipotle-founder-to-step-down-as-ceo-1511962551<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/11\/29\/chipotle-founder-steve-ells-stepping-down-as-ceo\/\"> https:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/11\/29\/chipotle-founder-steve-ells-stepping-down-as-ceo\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) show that there is an upward trend in new-home prices, similar to the trend the U.S. housing market experienced prior to 2008. Seeking Alpha examines this growth and states, “the U.S. housing bubble of 2000s, its boom and bust character in particular, had been defined largely by the investor's intent on flipping houses (buying houses in order to sell them within 12 months period and get capital gains).” Not only this, but poor management of assets without sufficient leverage also contributed to the housing market disaster. Even though there is insufficient evidence of this occurring now, investors remain wary.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_497\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/home-sales.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-497\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/home-sales-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Source: Rose Law Group Reporter[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some firms in Brooklyn, for example, reported that their Q3 earnings were the highest they’ve seen in nine years. “According to Corcoran’s [a New York real estate company’s] report, the median is $733,000, and the average is $856,000, based on 1,670 closed sales.” The increase in luxury homes is also helping to push prices higher throughout Brooklyn and other surrounding areas. Lower housing inventory is, across the board, not having an effect on housing sales, as Brooklyn’s “building boom” continues to meet the demands of the market.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking forward, there is concern amongst realtors that the newly passed tax reform bill will cause housing prices to drop in every state. Particularly, it is the changes within mortgage interest deduction that stands to lower housing prices. Under the current law, you can deduct mortgage interest “for purchases of up to $1,000,000 plus an additional $100,000 for equity debt.” Under the new tax bill, “the state and local property tax deduction would remain in place but would be capped at $10,000. Under the Senate bill, the property tax deduction would be eliminated.” The National Association of Realtors estimates that housing prices would fall by at least 10% all over the nation, hitting places like New York and New Jersey hard.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the government is trying to do is ensure that wealthier Americans do not take advantage of tax deductions that they do not necessarily need. Essentially, this generates more tax revenue from American taxpayers who might otherwise be able to find loopholes in the current mortgage interest deduction policy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kellyphillipserb\/2017\/12\/01\/realtors-predict-tax-bill-will-cause-housing-prices-to-drop-in-every-state\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFmuKUse7XAhWERCYKHS4RBUsQFgg_MAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkellyphillipserb%2F2017%2F12%2F01%2Frealtors-predict-tax-bill-will-cause-housing-prices-to-drop-in-every-state%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw22oKWufenUbniQGKVvVRSV<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/samanthasharf\/2017\/07\/19\/new-york-is-one-of-the-most-undervalued-housing-markets-of-2017-yes-really\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFmuKUse7XAhWERCYKHS4RBUsQFghFMAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fsamanthasharf%2F2017%2F07%2F19%2Fnew-york-is-one-of-the-most-undervalued-housing-markets-of-2017-yes-really%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw372wrvnl3g7jS90mPd9zuT<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd0_7zt-7XAhURON8KHSXPBH4QqQIIPCgAMAc&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Farticle%2F4128759-u-s-housing-market-brink-bubble&amp;usg=AOvVaw2p4HYl0HCGwrivALD5Eix_\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd0_7zt-7XAhURON8KHSXPBH4QqQIIPCgAMAc&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Farticle%2F4128759-u-s-housing-market-brink-bubble&amp;usg=AOvVaw2p4HYl0HCGwrivALD5Eix_<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org\/2011\/12\/flip-this-house-investor-speculation-and-the-housing-bubble.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+LibertyStreetEconomics+%28Liberty+Street+Economics%29\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org\/2011\/12\/flip-this-house-investor-speculation-and-the-housing-bubble.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+LibertyStreetEconomics+%28Liberty+Street+Economics%29<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ny.curbed.com\/2017\/10\/12\/16463208\/brooklyn-sales-q3-nyc-market-report\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/ny.curbed.com\/2017\/10\/12\/16463208\/brooklyn-sales-q3-nyc-market-report<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Even though there is insufficient evidence of this occurring now, investors remain wary.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_497\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/home-sales.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-497\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/home-sales-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Source: Rose Law Group Reporter[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some firms in Brooklyn, for example, reported that their Q3 earnings were the highest they’ve seen in nine years. “According to Corcoran’s [a New York real estate company’s] report, the median is $733,000, and the average is $856,000, based on 1,670 closed sales.” The increase in luxury homes is also helping to push prices higher throughout Brooklyn and other surrounding areas. Lower housing inventory is, across the board, not having an effect on housing sales, as Brooklyn’s “building boom” continues to meet the demands of the market.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking forward, there is concern amongst realtors that the newly passed tax reform bill will cause housing prices to drop in every state. Particularly, it is the changes within mortgage interest deduction that stands to lower housing prices. Under the current law, you can deduct mortgage interest “for purchases of up to $1,000,000 plus an additional $100,000 for equity debt.” Under the new tax bill, “the state and local property tax deduction would remain in place but would be capped at $10,000. Under the Senate bill, the property tax deduction would be eliminated.” The National Association of Realtors estimates that housing prices would fall by at least 10% all over the nation, hitting places like New York and New Jersey hard.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the government is trying to do is ensure that wealthier Americans do not take advantage of tax deductions that they do not necessarily need. Essentially, this generates more tax revenue from American taxpayers who might otherwise be able to find loopholes in the current mortgage interest deduction policy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kellyphillipserb\/2017\/12\/01\/realtors-predict-tax-bill-will-cause-housing-prices-to-drop-in-every-state\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFmuKUse7XAhWERCYKHS4RBUsQFgg_MAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkellyphillipserb%2F2017%2F12%2F01%2Frealtors-predict-tax-bill-will-cause-housing-prices-to-drop-in-every-state%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw22oKWufenUbniQGKVvVRSV<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/samanthasharf\/2017\/07\/19\/new-york-is-one-of-the-most-undervalued-housing-markets-of-2017-yes-really\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFmuKUse7XAhWERCYKHS4RBUsQFghFMAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fsamanthasharf%2F2017%2F07%2F19%2Fnew-york-is-one-of-the-most-undervalued-housing-markets-of-2017-yes-really%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw372wrvnl3g7jS90mPd9zuT<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd0_7zt-7XAhURON8KHSXPBH4QqQIIPCgAMAc&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Farticle%2F4128759-u-s-housing-market-brink-bubble&amp;usg=AOvVaw2p4HYl0HCGwrivALD5Eix_\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd0_7zt-7XAhURON8KHSXPBH4QqQIIPCgAMAc&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Farticle%2F4128759-u-s-housing-market-brink-bubble&amp;usg=AOvVaw2p4HYl0HCGwrivALD5Eix_<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org\/2011\/12\/flip-this-house-investor-speculation-and-the-housing-bubble.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+LibertyStreetEconomics+%28Liberty+Street+Economics%29\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org\/2011\/12\/flip-this-house-investor-speculation-and-the-housing-bubble.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+LibertyStreetEconomics+%28Liberty+Street+Economics%29<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ny.curbed.com\/2017\/10\/12\/16463208\/brooklyn-sales-q3-nyc-market-report\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/ny.curbed.com\/2017\/10\/12\/16463208\/brooklyn-sales-q3-nyc-market-report<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Zill Ratanji\r\n\r\nFebruary 18, 2018\r\n\r\nThis year's flu season has been absolutely brutal. Not only has it been affecting health care clinics, but also businesses nationwide. More employees taking off from work leads to more production being faltered, causing a standstill in the overall economy. Moreover, for small businesses, this effect can cause their whole work force to go missing, leaving no one to operate the business. To put this effect into perspective, “the total cost to employers could be $15.4 billion in lost productivity, or output…such a toll theoretically could cut first-quarter economic growth by three-tenths to four tenths of a percentage point, from a projected 2.6% annual rate to 2.2% or 2.3%” (Davidson). This shows how the effects of the flu spread far greater than just the medical field.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_501\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/shutterstock_126288149.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-501\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/shutterstock_126288149-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Source: Benzinga[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDue to these circumstances, businesses are considering giving their workers free flu shots to avoid such an epidemic to their firm. Although it may not guarantee a perfect success rate, it will be a great path towards prevention. Other businesses are even considering giving their employees paid sick leave. This will incentivize sick employees to stay home and avoid risking other employees from getting sick as well. “A recent study out of Florida Atlantic University found that, unsurprisingly, US workers without paid sick leave are more likely than those with paid sick leave to keep going to work when they’re ill” (Gillett). Therefore, businesses should reconsider their health care policies and procedures to prevent their businesses from entirely shutting down in cases of such an outbreak.\r\n\r\nBusinesses face losses that are employee related, but customer related too. Restaurants and other service organizations experience a great loss of customers because people are less willing to go out to eat and shop because of the flu. All in all, businesses have been suffering a great deal from this flu internally and externally.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2018\/02\/13\/nasty-flu-season-takes-toll-small-businesses\/321785002\/.\">www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2018\/02\/13\/nasty-flu-season-takes-toll-small-businesses\/321785002\/.<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/2018-flu-season-will-cost-employers-billions-2018-1\">www.businessinsider.com\/2018-flu-season-will-cost-employers-billions-2018-1<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Overall, investors have been pleased with this growth and lack of volatility. The first week in February, however, the markets took a plunge. Over the course of two days, the Dow fell more than 1,800 points. On February 5<sup>th<\/sup>, the Dow recorded its biggest one-day point drop in history, which was approximately 1,175 points.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_514\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/cow.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-514\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/cow-300x186.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"186\" \/><\/a> Source: ADVFN.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no specific reason for this decline, Business Insider gives a couple of theories on what may have caused it: tax cuts are working, workers are finally getting raises, interest rates (and inflation) could be going up, and the placement of the new Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. This volatility in the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 has caused anxiety among investors, but for the average person investing for retirement, daily market moves do not matter as much as they do for day traders. In fact, the best thing you can do, according to Business Insider, is to keep your money invested, and perhaps even invest more.\r\n\r\nSince the drop of over 1,800 points, the Dow Jones, as well as the rest of the market, has begun to correct itself. On January 26<sup>th<\/sup>, the Dow was slightly over 26,500 points. Following the drop, it dipped a little shy of 24,000 points. As of Friday, February 16<sup>th<\/sup>, the Dow closed at 25,219.38. Over the course of about ten days, the market slowly began creeping up again. Now is still a great time to invest; the Dow has a good chance of catching up and surpassing where it was within a couple of months.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/02\/06\/us-stock-futures-dow-data-earnings-market-sell-off-and-politics-on-the-agenda.html\">https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/02\/06\/us-stock-futures-dow-data-earnings-market-sell-off-and-politics-on-the-agenda.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/dow-jones-sp-500-volatility-cause-investors-to-panic-2018-2\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/dow-jones-sp-500-volatility-cause-investors-to-panic-2018-2<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/02\/investing\/why-dow-dropping\/index.html\">http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/02\/investing\/why-dow-dropping\/index.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Mark Kashani\r\n\r\nFebruary 18, 2018\r\n\r\nSince 2009, the stock market has seen relatively steady growth, with the exception of occasional small dips. Overall, investors have been pleased with this growth and lack of volatility. The first week in February, however, the markets took a plunge. Over the course of two days, the Dow fell more than 1,800 points. On February 5<sup>th<\/sup>, the Dow recorded its biggest one-day point drop in history, which was approximately 1,175 points.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_514\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/cow.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-514\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/cow-300x186.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"186\" \/><\/a> Source: ADVFN.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no specific reason for this decline, Business Insider gives a couple of theories on what may have caused it: tax cuts are working, workers are finally getting raises, interest rates (and inflation) could be going up, and the placement of the new Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. This volatility in the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 has caused anxiety among investors, but for the average person investing for retirement, daily market moves do not matter as much as they do for day traders. In fact, the best thing you can do, according to Business Insider, is to keep your money invested, and perhaps even invest more.\r\n\r\nSince the drop of over 1,800 points, the Dow Jones, as well as the rest of the market, has begun to correct itself. On January 26<sup>th<\/sup>, the Dow was slightly over 26,500 points. Following the drop, it dipped a little shy of 24,000 points. As of Friday, February 16<sup>th<\/sup>, the Dow closed at 25,219.38. Over the course of about ten days, the market slowly began creeping up again. Now is still a great time to invest; the Dow has a good chance of catching up and surpassing where it was within a couple of months.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/02\/06\/us-stock-futures-dow-data-earnings-market-sell-off-and-politics-on-the-agenda.html\">https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/02\/06\/us-stock-futures-dow-data-earnings-market-sell-off-and-politics-on-the-agenda.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/dow-jones-sp-500-volatility-cause-investors-to-panic-2018-2\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/dow-jones-sp-500-volatility-cause-investors-to-panic-2018-2<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/02\/investing\/why-dow-dropping\/index.html\">http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/02\/investing\/why-dow-dropping\/index.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

According to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside Gov<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s projections, the most drastic changes will occur within the allocation of government funding and the total deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_518\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/121211_white_house_capitol_ap_328.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-518\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/121211_white_house_capitol_ap_328-300x163.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"163\" \/><\/a> Source: Politico[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprisingly, the federal government is expected to allocate 28% of its total spending towards Medicare and general health spending. This is more than twice the average amount of money that has been put into health spending in previous years. One of Trump’s most notable goals was to “repeal and replace” Medicare and substitute it with something less costly, which is why the hefty 28% is shocking to many analysts. Compared to all preceding fiscal years, this is the most amount of money that the government has ever put into health spending.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although spending appears to be at a high, the total deficit as a percentage of GDP is at a low -2.3%, which is less than the historical average. As the debt ceiling rises it will become increasingly important for the Trump administration to keep this number as low as possible.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public debt as a percentage of GDP, on the other hand, is at an all-time high. Nevada Republican Senator Dean Heller's website says that \"as our national debt grows, the dollar is weakened and Americans have to work more so they can buy less.\" <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the remainder of the 2018 fiscal year Americans should be paying close attention to increasing inflation rates. Between the extensive debt that the United States is in and the Federal Reserve’s plan to increase interest rates, Americans can expect the dollar’s value to deplete. Although steadily increasing inflation generally promotes healthy economic expansion, the increasing interest rates and debt combined might counteract any foreseeable benefit that inflation would have on the American economy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/federal-budget.insidegov.com\/l\/121\/2018-Estimate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/federal-budget.insidegov.com\/l\/121\/2018-Estimate<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/10\/politics\/budget-deal-in-nlew-era-of-spending\/index.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/10\/politics\/budget-deal-in-nlew-era-of-spending\/index.htm<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Without proper regulation and safety system implemented, hackers can easily reroute the address of the recipients to their own wallet and receive their funds. Goldman Sachs, a multinational investment banking company, has recently noted the security flaws of the blockchain technology. They mentioned that they will be compliant towards their clients, but will be mindful that they “may be vulnerable to cyber attacks”. Another concern Goldman hitned at was how “nascent” the blockchain technology is. Governments across the globe are still deciding whether they need stricter regulations on cryptocurrency. Some have already announced stricter regulations, which can mean that cryptocurrency is potentially dangerous for Goldman Sachs. Additionally, there aren’t many places that accept cryptocurrency. Whether cryptocurrency will become the future is still a question at large. Despite these claims and concerns from Goldman, there has been little to no price drops in the markets. In fact, Bitcoin prices have increased by around 10% since the announcement. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindaily.co\/2018\/02\/27\/goldman-sachs-cites-risk-of-crypto-after-acquiring-crypto-exchange\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.coindaily.co\/2018\/02\/27\/goldman-sachs-cites-risk-of-crypto-after-acquiring-crypto-exchange\/<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-market-crash-explained-causes-2018-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-market-crash-explained-causes-2018-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/2017\/12\/19\/bitcoin-exchange-collapses-second-cyber-attack-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/2017\/12\/19\/bitcoin-exchange-collapses-second-cyber-attack-year\/<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "Jun Huang\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 2018\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, cryptocurrency has faced exponential rates of growth. The most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached an all time high of $20,000 in December 2017. Investors who purchased Bitcoin when the prices were in the thousands expected further potential from it. Some even say that prices will continue to skyrocket as cryptocurrency becomes more widely traded and accepted. <\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_522\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Goldman-Sachs-Considers-Launching-Cryptocurrency-Trading-Operation-1024x512-10-02-2017.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-522\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Goldman-Sachs-Considers-Launching-Cryptocurrency-Trading-Operation-1024x512-10-02-2017-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> Source: ETHNews.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On December 18th, 2017, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other major cryptocurrencies began plummeting. By the end of December, prices dropped by nearly 40%. It continued to plummet until it reached $7000 per Bitcoin, which is roughly a 65% drop from the all time high. The major reason for this crash was the concern towards regulatory crackdown in Asia. According to Business Insider, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that  \"legislative regulation [for bitcoin] will be definitely required in future.\" In addition, Chinese officials announced their plans to restrict access for major cryptocurrency platforms. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from stricter regulations, cryptocurrency possesses many inherent risks. Its greatest strength and weakness lies in the decentralized market. Without government control or regulation, both buyers and sellers are fully anonymous. However, the lack of regulation can also pose many threats. Without proper regulation and safety systems implemented, hackers can easily reroute the address of the recipients to their own wallet and receive those funds. Goldman Sachs, a multinational investment banking company, has recently noted the security flaws of the blockchain technology. They mentioned that they will be compliant towards their clients, but will be mindful that they “may be vulnerable to cyber attacks”. Another concern Goldman hinted at was how “nascent” the blockchain technology is. Governments across the globe are still deciding whether they need stricter regulations on cryptocurrency. Some have already announced stricter regulations, which can mean that cryptocurrency is potentially dangerous for Goldman Sachs. Additionally, there aren’t many places that accept cryptocurrency. Whether cryptocurrency will become the future is still up for debate. Despite these claims and concerns from Goldman, there has been little to no price drops in the markets.

    "post_content": "Basil Harding\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 2018\r\n\r\nLoretta Lee, a former Google Engineer says she was consistently sexually harassed and that Google’s “bro culture” contributed to her ordeal. Lee notes several specific acts of harassment such as male colleagues spiking her drink with whiskey and laughing about it. She also claims that when she approached her desk one day she found a male colleague on his hands and knees hiding underneath the desk. Lee claims that the next day that same co-worker who was hiding under her desk grazed her breasts when he grabbed her name tag to read her name. Lee also claims that she was shot at with nerf bullets and balls every day. She has since filed a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_531\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/google-sexual-harasment-7599.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-531\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/google-sexual-harasment-7599-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" \/><\/a> Source: The Indian Express[\/caption]\r\n\r\nLoretta Lee’s claims fit into a wider movement to end sexual harassment called #Metoo. The Metoo movement looks to end sexual harassment in all spheres including business. Google is known to be an innovative forward-thinking company. Their workplace culture is thought to be progressive and inclusive. The fact that a company like Google is struggling with maintaining a harassment-free work environment should make it abundantly clear to all companies that a safe work environment for all employees is not a given. Companies must take a series of definitive steps to prevent sexual harassment and empower employees to report any cases if they arise. One important step I believe companies need to implement into their sexual harassment training is a victim impact statement. Many would-be sexual harassers do not see the negative consequences of their behavior. By incorporating victim impact statements into sexual harassment training all employees will be able to fully recognize the harm that can come from someone being abused in that form.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2018\/03\/google-turned-a-blind-eye-to-toxic-bro-culture-lawsuit-says\/\">https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2018\/03\/google-turned-a-blind-eye-to-toxic-bro-culture-lawsuit-says\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/google-loretta-lee-lawsuit-alleges-harassment-2018-3\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/google-loretta-lee-lawsuit-alleges-harassment-2018-3<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Lee notes several specific acts of harassment such as male colleagues spiking her drink with whiskey and laughing about it. She also claims that when she approached her desk one day she found a male colleague on his hands and knees hiding underneath the desk. Lee claims that the next day that same co-worker who was hiding under her desk grazed her breasts when he grabbed her name tag to read her name. Lee also claims that she was shot at with nerf bullets and balls every day. She has since filed a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_531\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/google-sexual-harasment-7599.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-531\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/google-sexual-harasment-7599-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" \/><\/a> Source: The Indian Express[\/caption]\r\n\r\nLoretta Lee’s claims fit into a wider movement to end sexual harassment called #Metoo. The Metoo movement looks to end sexual harassment in all spheres including business. Google is known to be an innovative forward-thinking company. Their workplace culture is thought to be progressive and inclusive. The fact that a company like Google is struggling with maintaining a harassment free work environment should make it abundantly clear to all companies that a safe work environment for all employees is not a given. Companies must take a series of definitive steps to prevent sexual harassment and power employees to report any cases if they arise. One important step I believe companies need to uncorrupted into their sexual harassment training is victim impact statement. Many would-be sexual harassers do not see the negative consequences of their behavior. By incorporating victim impact statements into sexual harassment training all employees will be able to fully recognize the harm that can come from someone being abused in that form.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2018\/03\/google-turned-a-blind-eye-to-toxic-bro-culture-lawsuit-says\/\">https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2018\/03\/google-turned-a-blind-eye-to-toxic-bro-culture-lawsuit-says\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/google-loretta-lee-lawsuit-alleges-harassment-2018-3\">http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/google-loretta-lee-lawsuit-alleges-harassment-2018-3<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

Numerous factors contributed to the demise of Toys “R” Us. With the rise of big-box retailers banking on broad, low cost strategies such as Walmart and Target, specialty stores such as Toys “R” Us could not hold up to the competition. Also, with the gaining influence of the internet and websites such as Amazon killing the need for a middle man, people started buying toys and other merchandise with a click of a button; there was no longer a need to make an entire trip to Toys “R” Us to buy kids Christmas gifts when similar items were readily available to be purchased on any electronic device. This drastic shift away from traditional storefronts is damaging the retail industry and forcing companies that are still intact to shift to an online platform to remain relevant.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_542\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/800x-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-542\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/800x-1-300x203.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"203\" \/><\/a> Source: Bloomberg[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn September of 2017, Toys “R” Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and began selling stores and liquidating their assets. In 2017, more than 300 retailers have also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as they came under immense pressure from large retailers and online stores. Toys “R” Us planned to restructure the company after filing for bankruptcy in September, but did not manage to make enough to stay open and recover from their debt. Over the past decade, Toys “R” Us accumulated $5 billion in debt in an effort to remain on the grid in this heavily digital age; immense sales were not enough to save the company. On Thursday, March 15th, Toys “R” Us declared that unfortunately, it must liquidate its business, which would ultimately lead to the closure of 735 stores worldwide and the unemployment of 33,000 employees. The company’s last hope to remain intact was the outcome of the holiday season. However, Christmas of 2017 produced earnings at nearly 50% of a normal business year. The underperformance during the holiday season was the final indication that it was time for the company to shut down. Toys “R” Us will potentially remain open for another two months, which is around the time when they declared they will no longer be able to continue paying employees. The company hopes to maintain some stores outside of the United States which have proven more profitable. Sadly, stores in America will dissipate and in generations to come, kids will merely here the tale of when their parents and grandparents used to shop at Toys “R” Us.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/14\/news\/companies\/toys-r-us-closing-stores\/index.html\">http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/14\/news\/companies\/toys-r-us-closing-stores\/index.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/business\/2018\/03\/15\/toys-r-us-files-bankruptcy-liquidation\/427129002\/\">https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/business\/2018\/03\/15\/toys-r-us-files-bankruptcy-liquidation\/427129002\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

    "post_content": "Sherry Chen\r\n\r\nMarch 24, 2018\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, March 22, President Trump had officially announced tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump said the “US will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminum” to increase revenue in these industries (Diamond- CNN). This tariff policy will negatively impact international trading with other steel-producing countries, especially China. This strict measure will impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of China’s goods to combat the rising national threat (Landler and Tankersley- The New York Times).\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_548\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/fees-tariffs-sales-tax-on-imports.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-548\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/fees-tariffs-sales-tax-on-imports-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" \/><\/a> Source: Paychex[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTrump implied that this trade action is used against a country that he says is responsible for thousands of lost American jobs and billions in lost revenue. The White House emphasized that this tariff is in retaliation towards “China’s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets” (Landler and Tankersley). After Trump announced the moves, China’s Ministry of Commerce said that it was proposing tariffs of its own on “128 products from the United States, like nuts, wine and pork, that it valued at about $3 billion.” China urged the Trump administration to find a conciliation where the two nations can maintain a friendly economic relationship and to “avoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.”\r\n\r\nSome critics fear that these tariffs will cause a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. After Trump’s announcement, the financial markets plunged and the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 2.5%. Some Republican lawmakers stated that the tariffs would hurt the economy internally because it would increase costs for consumers. Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska harshly criticized Trump’s decision, as he said “the President is proposing a massive tax increase on American families.” On March 1, Trump tweeted that “Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world.

Trump said the “US will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminum” to increase revenue for the struggling industries (Diamond- CNN). This tariff policy will negatively impact the international trading with other steel-producing countries, especially China.

The White House emphasized that this tariff is in retaliation towards “China’s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets” (Landler and Tankersley). After Trump announced the moves, China’s Ministry of Commerce said that it was proposing tariffs of its own on “128 products from the United States, like nuts, wine and pork, that it valued at about $3 billion.” China urged the Trump administration to find a conciliation where the two nations can maintain a friendly economic relationship and to “avoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.”\r\n\r\nSome critics fear that these tariffs will cause a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. After Trump’s announcement, the financial markets plunged and the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index dropped by 2.5 percent.

Trump said the “US will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminum” to increase revenue in these industries (Diamond- CNN). This tariff policy will negatively impact international trading with other steel-producing countries, especially China. This strict measure will impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of China’s goods to combat the rising national threat (Landler and Tankersley- The New York Times).\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_548\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/fees-tariffs-sales-tax-on-imports.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-548\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/fees-tariffs-sales-tax-on-imports-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" \/><\/a> Source: Paychex[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTrump implied that this trade action is used against a country that he says is responsible for thousands of lost American jobs and billions in lost revenue. The White House emphasized that this tariff is in retaliation towards “China’s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets” (Landler and Tankersley). After Trump announced the moves, China’s Ministry of Commerce said that it was proposing tariffs of its own on “128 products from the United States, like nuts, wine and pork, that it valued at about $3 billion.” China urged the Trump administration to find a conciliation where the two nations can maintain a friendly economic relationship and to “avoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.”\r\n\r\nSome critics fear that these tariffs will cause a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. After Trump’s announcement, the financial markets plunged and the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 2.5%. Some Republican lawmakers stated that the tariffs would hurt the economy internally because it would increase costs for consumers. Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska harshly criticized Trump’s decision, as he said “the President is proposing a massive tax increase on American families.” On March 1, Trump tweeted that “Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!” The purpose of this tariff was to strategically to defend the US from China’s economic aggression and boost internal tariff revenue, but the outcome is uncertain.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/03\/22\/us\/politics\/trump-will-hit-china-with-trade-measures-as-white-house-exempts-allies-from-tariffs.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/03\/22\/us\/politics\/trump-will-hit-china-with-trade-measures-as-white-house-exempts-allies-from-tariffs.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/01\/politics\/steel-aluminum-trade-trump-chaos\/index.html\">https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/01\/politics\/steel-aluminum-trade-trump-chaos\/index.html<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

This type of monumental value was estimated by groups at “Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley” which has put this company’s predicted IPO in an outstanding position greater than the worth of various automobile companies like “General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Fiat Chrysler Automobile” all combined. With all that Uber has suffered the past year this 120 billion number is very notable. Just last year there was a sexual harassment investigation going on within the walls of Uber after 215 claims of harassment went unnoticed and also was further publicized by a blog post in which “a former employee detailed the sexual harassment she allegedly experienced at the company”, “Susan J. Fowler, an ex-Uber engineer, says she was propositioned by her manager and that human resources refused to act on her complaint, saying that it was a “first offense” and that they didn’t want to damage the career of a “high performer.” The lawsuit was again followed by the removal of former CEO Travis Kalanick after accusations against him in which he insulted a fellow Uber driver to take responsibility for the decrease rates and lower income as a result of it. That was not the end of Uber’s scandals for there was another lawsuit made in parts by Google’s Waymo accusing Uber of using similar mapping technology designs reflected in Waymo’s self-driving cars. Even with all these accusations happening all through last year and so, Uber is prepared to go out public early 2019 but even with this plan it still faces another oncoming danger to their IPO since Lyft is also rumored to go public alongside Uber. With all this scandal, Uber is trying its best to straighten itself out and restructure their company culture in order to disassociate itself from the incidents and make a dashing profit in upcoming years.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/uber-proposals-value-company-at-120-billion-in-a-possible-ipo-1539690343\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/23\/waymo-sues-uber-otto\/http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/06\/uber-sexual-harassment-investigation\/\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/21\/delete-uber-twitter\/\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/28\/uber-ceo-video-kalanick-driver\/",

Given that it was the 80’s, who could have predicted the emergence of technology, or the instability of mid-2000, or understood the science behind the volatile but gratifying stock market, it seemed to be an easy and effortless plan to guarantee a definite success. As stated by a timber broker explaining this once tree craze, “If you work and you didn’t want to put all your money in the stock market, you’d buy 40 acres and plant trees and they’d be ready to cut by the time your kid went to college...It’s like a 401(k).” Beside this rationale of the time, there was another factor pushing for this sensation-The U.S. Government. Back in the 80s to help fight a current agricultural trauma the Reagan Administration had an incentive, the Conservation Reserve Program, which paid farmers from “$30 to $50 dollars for each acre they planted with trees or grasses”; there was soon enough reasons for investors to go forward with this movement.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.15752-9\/44056309_1624325437673646_1665909456388489216_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&amp;oh=2b397a07bb041266fb27b2abb395d42d&amp;oe=5C5D68F1\" alt=\"\" width=\"437\" height=\"291\" \/>\r\nThe popular use of trees as a major building resource inevitably did not sit well with the housing crash of 2008.

The decade ago event has negatively affected the timber market of the South and the well thought out 401k’s of the people because soon many mills closed and leading to an overstock of goods. Although America is slowly recovering from the events of 2008, the timber market has not been able to recover that swiftly. Landowners are forced to sell their overstock logs at a lower price than decades ago to their nearby mills because no one wants to bear the costly responsibility of transporting thousand tons of large logs to the North to sell at higher price. In the end, what seemed to be a well thought out investment of the 80s, given time and recent tragedy turned to be a bust.

Sears has been having issues for years since shoppers favor have gone to online shopping and their rivals Walmart and Home Depot. There also recent store closings and cutting cost have made a damaging effect on the store. Dumping the Craftsman brand, as well as Lands End, continued to put fuel in the fire. Debt increased significantly, and Sear’s market value has fallen below $100 million. As of now the company is closing 188 stores country wide.<\/div>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/sears2-1260x800.jpg\"> <\/a>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">The Sears bankruptcy goes to show that the managerial authorities should have been changed or taken up by an individual that would lead them far from debt. The internal conflicts due to the competitions from the management, took a toll on the company. The slash in advertisement spending was a severe and disastrous action taken. The steps that they have taken to relieve debt, only hurt them more. I feel the only way to save this store-chain is to be bought by a large company. Sears being around since post- World War II, may have also run its course and may have to shut down, such as ToysRus and RadioShack.<\/div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/10\/15\/business\/sears-bankruptcy\/index.html?fbclid=IwAR3n1NTbuLOLd40w5eIPEbrk2ivILTA1oYFAbswiyQn6b-mRZS6fwZQyhiY\">https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/10\/15\/business\/sears-bankruptcy\/index.html?fbclid=IwAR3n1NTbuLOLd40w5eIPEbrk2ivILTA1oYFAbswiyQn6b-mRZS6fwZQyhiY<\/a>",

This type of monumental value was estimated by groups at “Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley” which has put this company’s predicted IPO in an outstanding position greater than the worth of various automobile companies like “General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Fiat Chrysler Automobile” all combined. With all that Uber has suffered the past year this 120 billion number is very notable. Just last year there was a sexual harassment investigation going on within the walls of Uber after 215 claims of harassment went unnoticed and also was further publicized by a blog post in which “a former employee detailed the sexual harassment she allegedly experienced at the company”, “Susan J. Fowler, an ex-Uber engineer, says she was propositioned by her manager and that human resources refused to act on her complaint, saying that it was a “first offense” and that they didn’t want to damage the career of a “high performer.” The lawsuit was again followed by the removal of former CEO Travis Kalanick after accusations against him in which he insulted a fellow Uber driver to take responsibility for the decrease rates and lower income as a result of it. That was not the end of Uber’s scandals for there was another lawsuit made in parts by Google’s Waymo accusing Uber of using similar mapping technology designs reflected in Waymo’s self-driving cars. Even with all these accusations happening all through last year and so, Uber is prepared to go out public early 2019 but even with this plan it still faces another oncoming danger to their IPO since Lyft is also rumored to go public alongside Uber. With all this scandal, Uber is trying its best to straighten itself out and restructure their company culture in order to disassociate itself from the incidents and make a dashing profit in upcoming years.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/uber-proposals-value-company-at-120-billion-in-a-possible-ipo-1539690343\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/23\/waymo-sues-uber-otto\/http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/06\/uber-sexual-harassment-investigation\/\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/21\/delete-uber-twitter\/\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/28\/uber-ceo-video-kalanick-driver\/",

Their solution, Proposition 10, is a legislation that would give states more power to implement rent control laws. The proposition suggests revoking the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, essentially allowing the state to implement rent control laws for more homes and apartments. The California Democratic Party and other advocates of the proposal argue that passing it would help reverse the lack of affordable housing currently available in Los Angeles, while opponents believe that passing the plan would lead to developers having less incentive to build new homes.\r\n\r\nBoth sides of the argument raise legitimate concerns. Lack of affordable housing is a severe issue that should be addressed, but if developers are not motivated to create more living spaces, there will be less units which cities can apply rent control laws to.

Their solution, Proposition 10, is a legislation that would give states more power to implement rent control laws. The proposition suggests revoking the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, essentially allowing the state to implement rent control laws for more homes and apartments. The California Democratic Party and other advocates of the proposal argue that passing it would help reverse the lack of affordable housing currently available in Los Angeles, while opponents believe that passing the plan would lead to developers having less incentive to build new homes.\r\n\r\nBoth sides of the argument raise legitimate concerns. Lack of affordable housing is a severe issue that should be addressed, but if developers are not motivated to create more living spaces, there will be less units which cities can apply rent control laws to. The solution, unfortunately, lies somewhere in the middle. Opponents main concern is that if the bill doesn’t pass, landlords will continue to raise rents.

Its purpose is to connect small carriers with fully filled trailers from big businesses (like brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev), helping big-rig truckers haul freight around the country. It has leased hundreds of trailers and is renting them for $25 a day. Related to this is Uber’s Freight division, which alerts truckers with empty trailers to waiting cargo loads (similar to Uber’s business of connecting people with rides). Uber has already accrued some success from UberEats, its food delivery unit, which may alleviate the losses from Powerloop. Because of a fast-growing U.S. economy, rates for last-minute truck transportation were up one-third from the year before, during what was supposed to be a slow time of the year. This means the trucking industry, which has always been considered cumbersome and cost-intensive, is squeezing U.S. businesses even more with rising freight costs and a tight capacity.\r\n\r\nUber expects to expand Powerloop outside of Texas, where it’s being tested now, which is a good move. While Powerloop sounds cost-intensive to maintain, I think it’s a great way for Uber to gain an advantage in multiple industries. For instance, the rise of e-commerce is dramatically affecting retail supply chains, since they have to ship their goods in smaller loads in order to meet consumer demand. This means a raise in transportation costs for businesses, who also have to pay rising contract rates, since trucking companies are so swamped with demand that they have to turn down freight. Uber is taking advantage of this: carriers can load trailers at their own convenience instead of waiting for them to arrive, which wastes time and increases costs. However, there is a lot of risk involved, especially if the economy slows down, which would impact manufacturing, and therefore the trucking industry. In addition, Uber faces competition from big tech players like C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. and Echo Global Logistics. Uber’s services also aren’t guaranteed to win over shippers, who could easily negotiate their own contracts and prices with trucking companies. However taking this risk could propel Uber into the trucking and retailing industries and lead to greater profits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/uber-targets-trucking-with-new-trailer-rental-business-1539781200?mod=djemCFO_h",

Just yesterday it was announced he is presumed to be dead, and Saudi government officials may be behind it. If this is true, many U.S. lawmakers are calling for sanctions against Saudi Arabia as a retaliation. However, if these sanctions are imposed Saudi Arabia may react by driving up oil prices. The price of oil is already a growing concern with planned sanctions on Iran already causing worry over supply constraints.\r\n\r\nAs of Friday, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan stated that the situation with Saudi Arabia is too unpredictable to, “significant effect on my thoughts on monetary policy.” It is clear to him that the sanctions on Iran will have a significant effect on the price of oil, but the Saudi situation is too unclear to judge at the moment.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Saudi Arabia is America’s greatest ally in the Middle East, against Iran. However, an attack on an American journalist cannot go unanswered. It is also important to note that Saudi Arabia is a member of NATO, an international agreement stating, “an attack on one is an attack on all.” If America does place sanctions on Saudi Arabia it could definitely has a drastic effect on the price of oil, but also have a major global effect that has yet to be foreseen.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/feds-kaplan-too-soon-to-know-how-saudi-tensions-could-affect-economy-1539982056?fbclid=IwAR2DFC0hQxZYtTuXTfrh8F-atdPsCvpnyWZpxMlZrdzuBypiD48_aRoIDeM\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/feds-kaplan-too-soon-to-know-how-saudi-tensions-could-affect-economy-1539982056?fbclid=IwAR2DFC0hQxZYtTuXTfrh8F-atdPsCvpnyWZpxMlZrdzuBypiD48_aRoIDeM<\/a>",

The core audience contains young adults and teens. About 57% percent of this body registered to vote. Partnering with a nonpartisan, Democracy Works, a portal was created within the app allowing users who were 18 and older to register to vote. Filters were also created to get the word about registration. Snapchat estimates it may have helped over 418,000 users register to vote.<\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">With the unhealthy division between in the country due to race, and injustice controversies and conflicts, the aid Snapchat provided for young adults to register to vote was need. It is our job, as the next generation to be apart of society by any means. The controversial presidential election of 2016 was the spark of this new voting urge. Continuing to the midterm elections, many of the public’s hope is their vote will help lead the Democrats to controlling the House. These midterm elections, just as the presidential election has high stakes and will greatly predict the rest of President Trump’s term.<\/div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/10\/23\/tech\/snapchat-vote-register-election\/index.html\">https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/10\/23\/tech\/snapchat-vote-register-election\/index.html<\/a>",

When the groom’s family and the bride’s family come together, it’s well supported and an interesting amalgamation. Similarly, companies too, pool their resources together and merge to become a super power. Recently, in an article I read “Amadeus to Buy TravelClick From Thoma Bravo for $1.52 Billion”, Spanish travel technology provider Amadeus IT Holding SA agreed to acquire New York peer business TravelClick Inc. from Thoma Bravo for $1.52 billion. Madrid-based Amadeus serves airlines, hotels, rail and ferry operators, travel agencies, and travel website operators as well as corporations and travel management companies. TravelClick provides cloud-based services, including a central reservation system for independent and midsize hotels and guest-management applications.\r\n\r\nCompanies acquiring other companies is common. The trend has been going for a while now, with firms expanding their horizons by venturing out and diversifying. It’s been seen before with huge companies like Amazon taking over Whole Foods. In order to be successful, it’s pivotal to move out of your comfort space and have a vision that incorporates more than just the hackneyed business fundamentals. Thoma is one of the many individuals that embodies the true entrepreneurial vision.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amadeus-to-buy-travelclick-from-thoma-bravo-for-1-52-billion-1533938188?fbclid=IwAR16Z-cpBvzl07YRYU1df2UaQ2ZDJt-pmv6VUTMvLszDoKdefJuaryGsDEU\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amadeus-to-buy-travelclick-from-thoma-bravo-for-1-52-billion-1533938188?fbclid=IwAR16Z-cpBvzl07YRYU1df2UaQ2ZDJt-pmv6VUTMvLszDoKdefJuaryGsDEU<\/a>",

This week, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman denied he had anything to do with the murder at the Saudi embassy in Turkey. Republican and Democratic lawmakers are reluctant to believe his story and are urging Trump to hold Saudi Arabia responsible. President Trump is reluctant to take action because America’s arms dealing with the Saudis brings in a lot of revenue for the U.S. However, lawmakers are arguing we don’t deal in arms for the revenue; we do it to maintain international allegiance. A murder of an American overseas would be a breach of that allegiance and appropriate action should be taken.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia is one of America’s greatest allies against Iran. However, with the attack at the Saudi embassy, can we really trust them to continue to be an ally? The cover story put out by the crown price makes no sense, and President Trump believing it despite the evidence would be the greatest show of weakness in his presidency. Something quite out of character for him. The global consequences of this attack could be vast.

This week, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman denied he had anything to do with the murder at the Saudi embassy in Turkey. Republican and Democratic lawmakers are reluctant to believe his story and are urging Trump to hold Saudi Arabia responsible. President Trump is reluctant to take action because America’s arms dealing with the Saudis brings in a lot of revenue for the U.S. However, lawmakers are arguing we don’t deal in arms for the revenue; we do it to maintain international allegiance. A murder of an American overseas would be a breach of that allegiance and appropriate action should be taken.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia is one of America’s greatest allies against Iran. However, with the attack at the Saudi embassy, can we really trust them to continue to be an ally? The cover story put out by the crown price makes no sense, and President Trump believing it despite the evidence would be the greatest show of weakness in his presidency. Something quite out of character for him. The global consequences of this attack could be vast. Bob Corker, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, argued that this could get the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany working with other countries to respond to Saudi Arabia. He very well could be right, should President Trump ask for backing from NATO to retaliate against Saudi Arabia. At this point, Trump is still figuring out how to take action during this, the biggest international crisis of his presidency, and we will have to continue to keep an eye on the story to see the repercussions of it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pri.org\/stories\/2018-10-16\/pompeo-meets-saudi-king-khashoggi-case-turks-study-toxic-materials\">https:\/\/www.pri.org\/stories\/2018-10-16\/pompeo-meets-saudi-king-khashoggi-case-turks-study-toxic-materials<\/a>",

This e-commerce business has known to be the cause of several deteriorations in businesses with their entrances into selling clothing, electronics, grocery, books, and etc. online. This step has hit revenues of known established stores such as Nordstrom, Macy's, JCPenney, Best Buy, many US grocery stores, and Barnes and Nobles, down with heavy competitions from Amazon’s part. However, even within the midst of so many of their wins, there is a company that has flourished when all the others were hit hard-Five Below. Five Below is a chain “which sells everything from Spalding basketballs to Bluetooth headphones and yoga mats for $5 or less”. They bring in products from suppliers from around the world, similar to Amazon, to sell at many physical locations filled with a certain charm of its own that Amazon hasn't implemented ever before.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Five Below stores often containing small floor plans, are “grouped around eight categories: sports, technology, party, candy, style, create, room and now\". Its core customers, preteens and teenagers, are encouraged to take full advantage of the store's layout by dribbling the basketballs, “test-driving radio-controlled cars and participating in slime-making contests”. Beside highly attracting the younger crowd, Five Below makes sure to look out for their older buyers too through the sell of yoga materials, skin care routines, vintage candy, and etc. The whole experience to Five Below is to have fun, explore, go on toy adventures, and take care of yourself through a shopping haul. All this is still done while saving a fortune on cost by buying everything under $5. “A study last year by KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. found that a basket of 67 items was 52.6% less expensive at Five Below than on Amazon.com”. Founded in 2002, this chain has survived 16 years flourishing even when so many other retailers have greatly deteriorated under the influential ventures of Amazon. Nevertheless, here we are with this company that even after almost a decade, has resisted Amazon’s charm and may continue to do so for many more years to come.<\/p>\r\nSources:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/five-below-becomes-the-amazon-proof-store-1541151001?mod=hp_lead_pos9\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/five-below-becomes-the-amazon-proof-store-1541151001?mod=hp_lead_pos9<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-is-killing-these-7-companies-2017-7#healthcare-companies-8\">https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-is-killing-these-7-companies-2017-7#healthcare-companies-8<\/a>",

Harvard’s Oliver Hart noted, Uber does not deal with many externalities and its competition with taxis enhances welfare for the general population. According to research done at the University of Chicago, “each $1 spent on Uberx rides generated a “consumer surplus” of $1.60.

Bruce Schaller, a transport consultant, estimates that the ride-hailing app adds 2.8 vehicle miles in American cities for every mile that is subtracted.

I am against New York City’s vote in August to have a cap for the number of ride-hailing cars that can be on the streets. This was enforced to protect Taxi drivers and regulate the industry.

It was trading around 3 percent higher around midday trading. This bump that occurred Wednesday October 31st, erases Facebook’s losses from last week where Facebook dropped 5.6 percent. However, along with this jump and an increase in revenue, Facebook revealed some missed expectations including less user number. The site has been continuously losing European and teenage users, while it has to deal with stricter privacy restrictions. During the Tuesday’s earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Facebook is following a refined strategy moving forward. He notioned that 2019 will be a year of investments as it continues to combat allegations of misinformation campaigns. The social media platform’s focus is to prevent security breaches, saving itself from another crisis.\r\n\r\nWednesday's surge will leave Facebook 10 percent lower at the end of October, a success to competitors Amazon and Netflix which are both losing up to 20 percent as they face market turmoil.\r\n\r\nOne might question how Facebook is still doing better than its competitors despite evidence of privacy breaches that occurred over this past year. It continues to race past rivals like Twitter and LinkedIn in terms of users and revenue. I believe it differentiates itself in terms of advertising and mobile trends. Small businesses comprise a majority of Facebook advertisements. Facebook pulls in approximately 12 billion just through advertising revenue. Equally important, Facebook accounts for 20 percent of the global online advertising market. Furthermore, Messenger has 1.2 billion monthly users. In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, bringing another billion users into its system. Among worldwide users, Facebook remains the most popular app.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/10\/31\/facebook-stock-pops-after-mixed-q3-earnings-candid-earnings-call.html\">https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/10\/31\/facebook-stock-pops-after-mixed-q3-earnings-candid-earnings-call.html<\/a>",

It was trading around 3 percent higher around midday trading. This bump that occurred Wednesday October 31st, erases Facebook’s losses from last week where Facebook dropped 5.6 percent. However, along with this jump and an increase in revenue, Facebook revealed some missed expectations including less user number. The site has been continuously losing European and teenage users, while it has to deal with stricter privacy restrictions. During the Tuesday’s earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Facebook is following a refined strategy moving forward. He notioned that 2019 will be a year of investments as it continues to combat allegations of misinformation campaigns. The social media platform’s focus is to prevent security breaches, saving itself from another crisis.\r\n\r\nWednesday's surge will leave Facebook 10 percent lower at the end of October, a success to competitors Amazon and Netflix which are both losing up to 20 percent as they face market turmoil.\r\n\r\nOne might question how Facebook is still doing better than its competitors despite evidence of privacy breaches that occurred over this past year. It continues to race past rivals like Twitter and LinkedIn in terms of users and revenue. I believe it differentiates itself in terms of advertising and mobile trends. Small businesses comprise a majority of Facebook advertisements. Facebook pulls in approximately 12 billion just through advertising revenue. Equally important, Facebook accounts for 20 percent of the global online advertising market. Furthermore, Messenger has 1.2 billion monthly users. In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, bringing another billion users into its system. Among worldwide users, Facebook remains the most popular app.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/10\/31\/facebook-stock-pops-after-mixed-q3-earnings-candid-earnings-call.html\">https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/10\/31\/facebook-stock-pops-after-mixed-q3-earnings-candid-earnings-call.html<\/a>",

The amount of mortgage applications to refinance have decreased by 32% over the last year. Refinancing has become less and less desirable of an option for homeowners as most have already secured lower interest rates in previous years. The demand for homes is high although buyers are becoming distraught by the increasing prices of homes. Monthly payments on homes have increased by 15% since last year. The rapid increase of volatility in the stock market has lead to much anticipation for a decrease in interest rates, although lenders don’t seem to be doing so anytime soon. This leads potential homeowners in fear of taking out mortgages because payments end up increasing and it becomes harder to pay it back and therefore do renovations to the house that is signed off. Although this is good because it gives an incentive to pay off the whole house faster, it makes some homeowners upset because if they can’t pay it off quick enough the family can not make any changes to the house.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/10\/24\/mortgage-applications-weaken-further-as-interest-rates-rise.html\">https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/10\/24\/mortgage-applications-weaken-further-as-interest-rates-rise.html<\/a><\/p>",

When the groom’s family and the bride’s family come together, it’s well supported and an interesting amalgamation. Similarly, companies too, pool their resources together and merge to become a super power. Recently, in an article I read “Amadeus to Buy TravelClick From Thoma Bravo for $1.52 Billion”, Spanish travel technology provider Amadeus IT Holding SA agreed to acquire New York peer business TravelClick Inc. from Thoma Bravo for $1.52 billion. Madrid-based Amadeus serves airlines, hotels, rail and ferry operators, travel agencies, and travel website operators as well as corporations and travel management companies. TravelClick provides cloud-based services, including a central reservation system for independent and midsize hotels and guest-management applications.\r\n\r\nCompanies acquiring other companies is common. The trend has been going for a while now, with firms expanding their horizons by venturing out and diversifying. It’s been seen before with huge companies like Amazon taking over Whole Foods. In order to be successful, it’s pivotal to move out of your comfort space and have a vision that incorporates more than just the hackneyed business fundamentals. Thoma is one of the many individuals that embodies the true entrepreneurial vision.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amadeus-to-buy-travelclick-from-thoma-bravo-for-1-52-billion-1533938188?fbclid=IwAR16Z-cpBvzl07YRYU1df2UaQ2ZDJt-pmv6VUTMvLszDoKdefJuaryGsDEU\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amadeus-to-buy-travelclick-from-thoma-bravo-for-1-52-billion-1533938188?fbclid=IwAR16Z-cpBvzl07YRYU1df2UaQ2ZDJt-pmv6VUTMvLszDoKdefJuaryGsDEU<\/a>",

Portal is a smart tablet type of device with a 12-megapixel camera on the front, and a large HD screen to help communication between two different ends. Facebook claims this device to be different then any other video messaging apps ever to be thought of before, but the release of this device has been met with uncertain reaction especially given their recent history. Facebook since this past year has been under major scrutiny due to a scandal with Cambridge Analytica revolving around Cambridge Analytica using the  “personal data of 50 million Facebook profiles... to map out voter behavior in 2016 for both the Brexit campaign and the US presidential election”. The personal data was provided to them through an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” where the builder of this app, Aleksandr Kogan, made a personality quiz that utilized people's personal information from their Facebook profiles. This incident came to light after a whistleblower within the Cambridge Analytica came out with \"we exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles” and described this situation as \"it is a full-service propaganda machine”.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div> Facebook claimed that this was not a data breach since Kogan was within his legal rights to obtain that data however they claim that he for sure misused that data when he sold it to Cambridge Analytica and violated Facebook’s rules. This scandal initially came to light on March 16 through a story covered by The Guardian which had a tragic effect on Facebook stocks. Before March 16 Facebook was trading at around $185 but the day after the release of that news. stocks fell to near $150.<\/div>\r\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/unnamed-1.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-668 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/unnamed-1-300x225.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"379\" height=\"284\" \/><\/a><\/div>\r\n<div>Given all these past negative incidents of Facebook, it is not a surprise that there are various mixed feelings on the Facebook new release of the Portal. Author Joanna Stern from WSJ describes her relationship to this new device as unwilling and skeptical. Portal's target audience is “families, and particularly those with young children and grandparents who live hundreds of miles apart.” With a “140-degree field of view” camera, the Portal has this ability that when it “recognizes a human in the frame, it crops the image and zooms in, and it does so smoothly as a skilled cinematographer would” without even the person’s permission. It is not surprising that Joanna Stern is hesitant to place this device in her home life from a company that has a history storing customer details and behavior and releasing them to outside parties for marketing purposes.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>Sources:<\/div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/tech\/5843838\/facebook-data-scandal-cambridge-analytica-safe\/\">https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/tech\/5843838\/facebook-data-scandal-cambridge-analytica-safe\/<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/facebook-portal-smart-home-device\/\">https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/facebook-portal-smart-home-device\/<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/13822\/facebook-share-price\/\">https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/13822\/facebook-share-price\/<\/a><\/div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-portal-non-review-why-i-didnt-put-facebooks-camera-in-my-home-1541685600?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-portal-non-review-why-i-didnt-put-facebooks-camera-in-my-home-1541685600?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2<\/a><\/div>",

Flavored pod-style cartridges that contain nicotine are used in order to get a head rush that is addictive. Although thee devices are used in order to get off smoking cigarettes, this causes many children who would never even try cigarettes to get addicted to nicotine itself due to the fun flavors the companies offer. “The Food and Drug Administration plans to sharply restrict the sale of most flavored pod-style e-cigarettes” in order to limit the use of it amongst teenagers. I think this is a bold and smart move by the FDA. These e-cigarettes are extremely addictive and harmful to teenagers and children and I believe it is way too easy to get access to them now. I do not think it should be as easily accessible in convenience stores as it is. Although this will limit some consumer spending on the companies and less money flow the market, overall it benefits our children and our friends and I think sometimes we need to put our health before our profits. <\/span><\/p>\r\nSource:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/fda-plans-to-sharply-restrict-sales-of-flavored-e-cigarettes-1541731110?mod=hp_listb_pos1\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/fda-plans-to-sharply-restrict-sales-of-flavored-e-cigarettes-1541731110?mod=hp_listb_pos1<\/a>",

Flavored pod-style cartridges that contain nicotine are used in order to get a head rush that is addictive. Although thee devices are used in order to get off smoking cigarettes, this causes many children who would never even try cigarettes to get addicted to nicotine itself due to the fun flavors the companies offer. “The Food and Drug Administration plans to sharply restrict the sale of most flavored pod-style e-cigarettes” in order to limit the use of it amongst teenagers. I think this is a bold and smart move by the FDA. These e-cigarettes are extremely addictive and harmful to teenagers and children and I believe it is way too easy to get access to them now. I do not think it should be as easily accessible in convenience stores as it is. Although this will limit some consumer spending on the companies and less money flow the market, overall it benefits our children and our friends and I think sometimes we need to put our health before our profits. <\/span><\/p>\r\nSource:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/fda-plans-to-sharply-restrict-sales-of-flavored-e-cigarettes-1541731110?mod=hp_listb_pos1\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/fda-plans-to-sharply-restrict-sales-of-flavored-e-cigarettes-1541731110?mod=hp_listb_pos1<\/a>",

Snap Inc. had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in March of 2017. Barring\r\nsome times, this stock has had a consistent negative trend since its IPO. According to the article,\r\nSnap has yet to report a profit as a publicly traded company, but the CEO Evan Spiegel has\r\nvision of profitability as soon as 2019.\r\n\r\nThe article reports that while this quarter Snap’s revenues are higher, by almost 5% more\r\nthan expected ($297.7 million as compared to $283 million expected), their core user base\r\ndeclined by 2 million users.

Snap included a more advertiser-friendly page and this drove many people\r\nto abandon usage of the app.\r\n\r\nThis phenomena shows how some pragmatic business decisions can drive consumers\r\naway. Snap presumably redesigned its app to attract more advertisers and thus increase\r\nadvertising revenue on their app. This was a smart business decision because Snapchat is a free\r\napp to use and their only consumer-contributed revenues would be from their sale of Snapchat\r\nmerchandise and Snapchat Spectacles.

Beijing has already had these problems which the trade war could make even worse. China’s economy is now growing at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. Although the Trump administration has put new tariffs on $200 billion Chinese good, exports have are still growing strongly, but may change in the months to come. China’s yuan, has sunken more that 9% against the dollar since January, and has boosted China’s huge export industry, making Chinese products cheaper on global markets. Chinese officials have turned to tax cuts, infrastructure spending and looser monetary policy as they seek to prop up growth.<\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">There is no quick-fix to China’s economic troubles. It will take years for China to get back on track due to the Trade War on top of there already cumulative economic troubles.  The Trade War will make it financially difficult to work towards the economic troubles. Imposing these tax cuts and infrastructure spending, may have not been the best option for recovering from these troubling times. I think China should focusing on having their currency going back to its appropriate amount. In turn, their export industry will grow and the nations products sold globally can draw more money in to the China.<\/div>\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/11\/09\/economy\/china-economy-risks\/index.html\">https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/11\/09\/economy\/china-economy-risks\/index.html<\/a>",

Beijing has already had these problems which the trade war could make even worse. China’s economy is now growing at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. Although the Trump administration has put new tariffs on $200 billion Chinese good, exports have are still growing strongly, but may change in the months to come. China’s yuan, has sunken more that 9% against the dollar since January, and has boosted China’s huge export industry, making Chinese products cheaper on global markets. Chinese officials have turned to tax cuts, infrastructure spending and looser monetary policy as they seek to prop up growth.<\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">There is no quick-fix to China’s economic troubles. It will take years for China to get back on track due to the Trade War on top of there already cumulative economic troubles.  The Trade War will make it financially difficult to work towards the economic troubles. Imposing these tax cuts and infrastructure spending, may have not been the best option for recovering from these troubling times. I think China should focusing on having their currency going back to its appropriate amount. In turn, their export industry will grow and the nations products sold globally can draw more money in to the China.<\/div>\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/11\/09\/economy\/china-economy-risks\/index.html\">https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/11\/09\/economy\/china-economy-risks\/index.html<\/a>",

An initial spark of the company’s downfall was the boost in online shopping and the consumer’s choice of Walmart and Home Depot over Sears. Debt significantly increased, and Sears’ market value had fallen below $100 million and 188 stores have closed. Now going in depth to the financial recordings of the company, some suspicion has arose. “Yet sears spent $6 billion buying back its own shares since 2005 in a futile effort to help support is stock price”; a process known as stock buybacks. The company’s final repurchase was in 2011 and priced at 2.8 million. Massachusett economics Professor William Lazoick shares,”If they had put $6 billion into upgrading stores and website development, they could be in a very different position right now”. Sears declined to comment about its shares repurchasing record.<\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">Upon first reading of the Sears bankruptcy, I had believed they had a chance at recovery if there were more control over the managerial aspects of the company. Now learning of the $6 billion that went to stock buybacks from 2005 to 2011 is shocking. If the company did not see an increase in their earnings the first round of the buybacks it should have not continued. I agree with Lazoick. If this money went to improvements and steps to be more consumer ideal, Sears would have not have had to file bankruptcy. Sears may have been able to generate a steady increase of revenue to pay off old debts.<\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/10\/30\/business\/sears-share-repurchase\/index.html\">https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/10\/30\/business\/sears-share-repurchase\/index.html<\/a><\/div>",

Snap Inc. had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in March of 2017. Barring\r\nsome times, this stock has had a consistent negative trend since its IPO. According to the article,\r\nSnap has yet to report a profit as a publicly traded company, but the CEO Evan Spiegel has\r\nvision of profitability as soon as 2019.\r\n\r\nThe article reports that while this quarter Snap’s revenues are higher, by almost 5% more\r\nthan expected ($297.7 million as compared to $283 million expected), their core user base\r\ndeclined by 2 million users. This is due to the app’s redesign in early 2018 and its poor reception\r\nby its main user base. Snap included a more advertiser-friendly page and this drove many people\r\nto abandon usage of the app.\r\n\r\nThis phenomena shows how some pragmatic business decisions can drive consumers\r\naway. Snap presumably redesigned its app to attract more advertisers and thus increase\r\nadvertising revenue on their app. This was a smart business decision because Snapchat is a free\r\napp to use and their only consumer-contributed revenues would be from their sale of Snapchat\r\nmerchandise and Snapchat Spectacles. The company saw a way to grow their top line and likely\r\nknew this would drive away users but would have thought the additional revenue to be worth\r\nlosing users over.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Snap made the right decision because they are now publicly traded and\r\nthus what matters the most is their revenues and profits. As an IPO that has consistently done\r\nextremely poorly in the past, I think it is a good goal they are working towards. If the trend\r\ncontinues the goal of profitability is definitely attainable and I believe that this decision will also\r\nhelp them finance some of the costs of building a better company has a whole. They have already\r\nmade leeway into more strategic growth by recruiting Jeremi Gorman, head of global advertising\r\nsales at Amazon (for obvious reasons, and Jared Grusd, chief executive of the Huffington Post to\r\nbe Snap’s new strategy chief (again, there is a pattern). They also have added a new director of\r\nproduct design for its innovation team, Snap Lab, in October. If they continue to grow their\r\nrevenue, the can make even more strides into being a better company for the common man to\r\ninvest in.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/snap-loses-users-but-wrings-more-money-from-those-who-stayed-1540499038\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/snap-loses-users-but-wrings-more-money-from-those-who-stayed-1540499038<\/a>",

But the surprises are that rather than choosing one location Amazon could not resist nor deny the charms of two cities and thus resulting in “HQ2” locations being- Long Island City, NY and Crystal City, Northern Virginia. What started with 20 different choices ranging from Dallas, Nashville, Los Angeles, Miami, Denver, Pittsburg, and etc. now has been narrowed down to only two final locations. The reason for Amazon choosing Long Island City was partly its history as an industrial hotspot for a while now. Long Island City is a continuously growing neighborhood that lies against the East River and is highly “accessible by multiple subway lines, the Long Island Rail Road and two ferry stops”. It is also close to La Guardia and John F. Kennedy International airports. There were 4 other neighborhoods in the New York area that Amazon's eyes were lingering on but it seemed the accessibility and the attraction of this ever-growing place had won out Amazon’s heart. The second location, Crystal County, Northern Virginia was also chosen due to similar reasons. “Its sheer size and proximity to Washington, Reagan National Airport, metro stops, and other transportation, made it an attractive prospect for Amazon’s ambitious second-headquarters plan, according to people who have been involved in the discussions”. There were also other various factors that Amazon looked at such as the Industry and Workforce, Tech Labor Force, Education, Transportation, and Housing, and Culture within the borders of those cities compared to the national average. The results of these comparisons show why the need for Amazon’s “HQ2” in Long Island City and Crystal City with how well the two excelled above and beyond in majority categories against the US national average. But otherwise finally going public with their final choices, Amazon’s is giving hope for these two city’s local population and government. Through choosing two locations Amazon is hoping to bring in a higher amount of job then when choosing only one but also not drastically affect the housing market nearby to make living inaccessible to others.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-chooses-new-york-city-and-northern-virginia-for-additional-headquarters-1542075336\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-chooses-new-york-city-and-northern-virginia-for-additional-headquarters-1542075336<\/a>",

But the surprises are that rather than choosing one location Amazon could not resist nor deny the charms of two cities and thus resulting in “HQ2” locations being- Long Island City, NY and Crystal City, Northern Virginia. What started with 20 different choices ranging from Dallas, Nashville, Los Angeles, Miami, Denver, Pittsburg, and etc. now has been narrowed down to only two final locations. The reason for Amazon choosing Long Island City was partly its history as an industrial hotspot for a while now. Long Island City is a continuously growing neighborhood that lies against the East River and is highly “accessible by multiple subway lines, the Long Island Rail Road and two ferry stops”. It is also close to La Guardia and John F. Kennedy International airports. There were 4 other neighborhoods in the New York area that Amazon's eyes were lingering on but it seemed the accessibility and the attraction of this ever-growing place had won out Amazon’s heart. The second location, Crystal County, Northern Virginia was also chosen due to similar reasons. “Its sheer size and proximity to Washington, Reagan National Airport, metro stops, and other transportation, made it an attractive prospect for Amazon’s ambitious second-headquarters plan, according to people who have been involved in the discussions”. There were also other various factors that Amazon looked at such as the Industry and Workforce, Tech Labor Force, Education, Transportation, and Housing, and Culture within the borders of those cities compared to the national average. The results of these comparisons show why the need for Amazon’s “HQ2” in Long Island City and Crystal City with how well the two excelled above and beyond in majority categories against the US national average. But otherwise finally going public with their final choices, Amazon’s is giving hope for these two city’s local population and government. Through choosing two locations Amazon is hoping to bring in a higher amount of job then when choosing only one but also not drastically affect the housing market nearby to make living inaccessible to others.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-chooses-new-york-city-and-northern-virginia-for-additional-headquarters-1542075336\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-chooses-new-york-city-and-northern-virginia-for-additional-headquarters-1542075336<\/a>",

On my right is someone streaming Netflix and on my left is someone playing Fortnite, both on their Macbooks. From the iPod to the iTouch to the iPhone, Apple has taken the tech world by storm. We are enveloped by their products, whether it be on the subway, school or even on our kitchen table. Other companies have made their mark too such as Samsung and Sony. Dell, however, was once a tech sensation with their products seen as revolutionary and selling through the roof. In the article I recently read, “Dell Technologies Confirms Deal That Would Mark Return to Public Markets” the company is trying to recapture their market share and once known glory. PC maker Dell Technologies said Monday that it plans to buy the publicly traded DVMT, which tracks VMware. Each share of Dell Technologies Class V stock will be converted into about 1.37 shares of Class C common stock, Dell Technologies said. The implied value of the Class V shares is $109 a share, it added.\r\n\r\nWe live in a cutthroat world, where the consumer demand is highly volatile. What may have been considered revolutionary yesterday can be seen as archaic today. It’s important to step outside your comfort zone and venture out. Diversification is key in today’s tech savvy world. There’s no cap on creativity and the will to be anything but ordinary is key.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dell-technologies-confirms-deal-that-would-mark-return-to-public-markets-1530531406?tesla=y\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dell-technologies-confirms-deal-that-would-mark-return-to-public-markets-1530531406?tesla=y<\/a>",

We are enveloped by their products, whether it be on the subway, school or even on our kitchen table. Other companies have made their mark too such as Samsung and Sony. Dell, however, was once a tech sensation with their products seen as revolutionary and selling through the roof. In the article I recently read, “Dell Technologies Confirms Deal That Would Mark Return to Public Markets” the company is trying to recapture their market share and once known glory. PC maker Dell Technologies said Monday that it plans to buy the publicly traded DVMT, which tracks VMware. Each share of Dell Technologies Class V stock will be converted into about 1.37 shares of Class C common stock, Dell Technologies said. The implied value of the Class V shares is $109 a share, it added.\r\n\r\nWe live in a cutthroat world, where the consumer demand is highly volatile. What may have been considered revolutionary yesterday can be seen as archaic today. It’s important to step outside your comfort zone and venture out. Diversification is key in today’s tech savvy world. There’s no cap on creativity and the will to be anything but ordinary is key.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dell-technologies-confirms-deal-that-would-mark-return-to-public-markets-1530531406?tesla=y\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dell-technologies-confirms-deal-that-would-mark-return-to-public-markets-1530531406?tesla=y<\/a>",

Not only in stock price, but its reputation and employee morale has been declining. An internal survey taken by around 29,000 employees revealed that the overall workplace attitude had turned colder and more bitter compared to a year ago. Recently, many employees are not hopeful for Facebooks future as a successful company and some intend to stay with the company for less than a year. Many employees feel this way because they feel that the leaders of the company are having issues responding to many controversies internally and externally. Employees state that they were worried about “Facebook’s sharpened focus on growth and frustrated over a “lack of innovation” within the company”. In my opinion, these complaints and concerns from the employees are seen through the app from a user’s perspective. In my experience with using Facebook, its lost its reputation as somewhere we can go directly to for social media purposes. We lean more towards Instagram now. Maybe it is because all of the excess suggested posts for us, or the media that is trying to spread false information about politics and other things. There is just so much on Facebook that is not filtered through enough for our own personal feeds that it becomes a hassle to use. We have other apps for messaging and another app strictly for pictures, and Facebook is starting to seem like a bland middle option between the two. Also, Facebook’s stock has been declining because of the backlash Mark Zuckerberg has been getting through the media as well. They make it seem like everything he is doing is wrong, which affects the reputation of his business. Overall, I am not surprised that Facebook stock price is declining.<\/span><\/p>\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-morale-takes-a-tumble-along-with-stock-price-1542200400\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-morale-takes-a-tumble-along-with-stock-price-1542200400<\/a>",

He grew up in Chennai India where he did not have much. In fact, he lived in a “modest house, shared with tenants” (Gelles 2018) where he had to sleep on the living room floor. The worst part was that there was a drought while he was growing up and now he cannot sleep without having a bottle of water right next to his bed. Despite these shortcomings, Pichai was a voracious reader and his daily activities consisted almost entirely of playing cricket with friends and reading. Pichai says he never felt like lacked anything. To him, those two things were the totality of life (Gelles, 2018). He later attended Stanford before starting to officially work for Google. When he was asked whether Google had remained the same, he responded by saying that the optimism and idealism have remained despite the company’s recent increase in failures. He also notes that there are a plethora of challenges, but those challenges are what make everything exciting. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another Topic that is talked about in the interview is censorship, specifically, how can pornography be easily censored while propaganda, misinformation and disturbing content aimed at kids cannot. Pichai answered by saying that it is quite perplexing to know what is “O.K” in society and what is “Not O.K”. There is a difference between somebody using their freedom of speech to state an opinion and explicit content that is not meant to be shown to children. Pichai concludes the interview by stating that Silicon Valley has retained its optimism, but there is a small shift. That optimism has tampered with a sense of deliberation. There is a lot more thought put into the actions of Google. Pichai concludes that technology will never solve humanity’s problems and it is wrong to think that technology is the problem and also the solution we need to rely on. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">    <\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article brings about a lot of different topics and ideas. The first one being the idea what is right and what is wrong. Is it right to ban pornography but not ban somebody who is saying that climate change does exist? Climate change as a matter a fact does exist, why? Because there have been tests done with infrared radiation through carbon dioxide molecules that show that there is an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Despite having the proof, you will still see people that will disregard it just because that is how they feel about the topic. Does that mean that a business should lie about or exaggerate on their success? Should we remove the right to free speech? The answer is it’s complicated because whatever happens, it can be abused and adulterated. Everything is a choice and the actions that you take. Society has started to evolve very fast and there Pichai points out that there is a lot more thought that needs to put because Google needs to know whether it will meet the customer’s demands and whether the customers will not find it controversial. Anything that is released to the public can be rated and judged, which can ultimately make or break a company. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   <\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another important thing that Pichai talks about is optimism in the face of obstacles. Obstacles are not necessarily a negative thing, but rather a catalyst to improve oneself. Problems are there to be thought about. If everything was perfect, there would be no need for society to improve and technology would never advance. Speaking of technology, Pachai emphasizes that we cannot rely on technology to fix humanities’ problems. Technology was created by humans and humans are responsible for making the right choices and using the technology properly. I very much agree with this statement as I believe it not the technology but what to do with it that makes it either useful or worthless. On top of that, it is our choice to purchase whatever technology we want, we should not be moved by what the majority uses if we know better. This article motivates me to work harder and to be more optimistic in the face of problems. It reminded me to enjoy the fact that I am challenged as well how much I have grown from facing a multitude of problems. <\/span>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/08\/business\/sundar-pichai-google-corner-office.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/08\/business\/sundar-pichai-google-corner-office.html The never-ending battle of society and technology<\/a>",

But the surprises are that rather than choosing one location Amazon could not resist nor deny the charms of two cities and thus resulting in “HQ2” locations being- Long Island City, NY and Crystal City, Northern Virginia. What started with 20 different choices ranging from Dallas, Nashville, Los Angeles, Miami, Denver, Pittsburg, and etc. now has been narrowed down to only two final locations. The reason for Amazon choosing Long Island City was partly its history as an industrial hotspot for a while now. Long Island City is a continuously growing neighborhood that lies against the East River and is highly “accessible by multiple subway lines, the Long Island Rail Road and two ferry stops”. It is also close to La Guardia and John F. Kennedy International airports. There were 4 other neighborhoods in the New York area that Amazon's eyes were lingering on but it seemed the accessibility and the attraction of this ever-growing place had won out Amazon’s heart. The second location, Crystal County, Northern Virginia was also chosen due to similar reasons. “Its sheer size and proximity to Washington, Reagan National Airport, metro stops, and other transportation, made it an attractive prospect for Amazon’s ambitious second-headquarters plan, according to people who have been involved in the discussions”. There were also other various factors that Amazon looked at such as the Industry and Workforce, Tech Labor Force, Education, Transportation, and Housing, and Culture within the borders of those cities compared to the national average. The results of these comparisons show why the need for Amazon’s “HQ2” in Long Island City and Crystal City with how well the two excelled above and beyond in majority categories against the US national average. But otherwise finally going public with their final choices, Amazon’s is giving hope for these two city’s local population and government. Through choosing two locations Amazon is hoping to bring in a higher amount of job then when choosing only one but also not drastically affect the housing market nearby to make living inaccessible to others.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-chooses-new-york-city-and-northern-virginia-for-additional-headquarters-1542075336\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-chooses-new-york-city-and-northern-virginia-for-additional-headquarters-1542075336<\/a>",

On my right is someone streaming Netflix and on my left is someone playing Fortnite, both on their Macbooks. From the iPod to the iTouch to the iPhone, Apple has taken the tech world by storm. We are enveloped by their products, whether it be on the subway, school or even on our kitchen table. Other companies have made their mark too such as Samsung and Sony. Dell, however, was once a tech sensation with their products seen as revolutionary and selling through the roof. In the article I recently read, “Dell Technologies Confirms Deal That Would Mark Return to Public Markets” the company is trying to recapture their market share and once known glory. PC maker Dell Technologies said Monday that it plans to buy the publicly traded DVMT, which tracks VMware. Each share of Dell Technologies Class V stock will be converted into about 1.37 shares of Class C common stock, Dell Technologies said. The implied value of the Class V shares is $109 a share, it added.\r\n\r\nWe live in a cutthroat world, where the consumer demand is highly volatile. What may have been considered revolutionary yesterday can be seen as archaic today. It’s important to step outside your comfort zone and venture out. Diversification is key in today’s tech savvy world. There’s no cap on creativity and the will to be anything but ordinary is key.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dell-technologies-confirms-deal-that-would-mark-return-to-public-markets-1530531406?tesla=y\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dell-technologies-confirms-deal-that-would-mark-return-to-public-markets-1530531406?tesla=y<\/a>",

This decrease had led to an intense discussion within the Federal Reserve on what steps to take next given recently troubled circumstances, in particular, the nation's interest rates. “Fed officials have signaled in recent days they plan to proceed with another quarter percentage point increase in their benchmark short-term interest rate when they meet Dec. 19, marking their fourth rate increase this year”. However, some data shown in the last Fed’s meeting have split the team in half regarding the decision to raise interest rates.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>“The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply Tuesday to its sixth drop in eight trading days, a move that has wiped out its gains for the year”. Given these stock troubles, investors are worried the raised interest rate can lead to an “economic weakness in the US and abroad” then what Fed officials may be able to count on. Important individuals such as Stanley Druckenmiller, investor, hedge fund manager, and a philanthropist, are vocalizing the need for the Fed to slow down and to simply observe the market before securing a decision. Then there is Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, LP, who “argued that the Fed’s interest-rate hikes will hurt asset prices and that such share weakness will, in turn, undercut the economy”.

This decrease had led to an intense discussion within the Federal Reserve on what steps to take next given recently troubled circumstances, in particular, the nation's interest rates. “Fed officials have signaled in recent days they plan to proceed with another quarter percentage point increase in their benchmark short-term interest rate when they meet Dec. 19, marking their fourth rate increase this year”. However, some data shown in the last Fed’s meeting have split the team in half regarding the decision to raise interest rates.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>“The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply Tuesday to its sixth drop in eight trading days, a move that has wiped out its gains for the year”. Given these stock troubles, investors are worried the raised interest rate can lead to an “economic weakness in the US and abroad” then what Fed officials may be able to count on. Important individuals such as Stanley Druckenmiller, investor, hedge fund manager, and a philanthropist, are vocalizing the need for the Fed to slow down and to simply observe the market before securing a decision. Then there is Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, LP, who “argued that the Fed’s interest-rate hikes will hurt asset prices and that such share weakness will, in turn, undercut the economy”. These opinions were then heavily complicated by our President, Donald Trump, who downright went to central banks to campaign for the need to halt interest rate increases. His response to this matter, “ I’d like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate. We have much more of a Fed problem than we have a problem with anyone else.”<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s response to this is that “market conditions are “one of many factors” the Fed considers when deciding where to set its benchmark rates”.

However, this one is different because this one is expected to be one of the strongest holiday seasons in years. Although people are buying more this holiday season, it is more through online shopping rather than in store. It is just so much easier to get anything you want delivered to you in about two to three days rather than going into the store and standing on the extremely long line with other customers for the same deal. On Thanksgiving, U.S. shoppers “spent $3.7 billion online, a 28% increase from a year earlier”. This all leads to how it affects the retail stores that are located in shopping malls and local towns. They are left with extra inventory and an aspiration to fix up outdated stores. In order to fix this issue and make it easier for the consumer in stores, the Kohl’s Corp. CEO says the chain will reduce the amount of inventory it carries and will buy closer to Thanksgiving. I think this is a great idea because not only will there be less extra inventory, but the inventory will also be more in with the time and up to date rather than old styles of clothing or toys. Although many companies believe that their strategies will call for more people to come into their retail store on Black Friday, I believe that over the years people will realize how much easier it is to shop online and will do that instead, forcing companies to create better markups online. Personally, I went into the mall the night of Black Friday and saw that it was not only emptier than usual (I was able to find parking easily), but there was also not a lot of options that I liked, so I did not buy anything. However, I went online the next day and ordered clothing and accessories.

In 2012, Clayton, Dubilier and Rice purchased the company in a 1.05 billion leveraged buyout, which made them one of the many retailers that have struggled with their debt loads after being acquired. The decline in marriage rates is factor which played apart in the growing debts. Online competition and wholesale prices, have driven customers away David’s Bridal. Before taking steps to declare bankruptcy, David’s Bridal negotiated a deal with creditors for $60 million in new financing and a recommitment for a $125 million revolving credit facility.  Stores have not been announced to close as of yet, and the company plans to exit bankruptcy in early January.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">David’s Bridal is an amazing store; my mother even had bought her wedding dress from there. I think that the business in weddings is very delicate and unpredictable, where as there may be good business one season and bad another. Due to this fact, I feel it may take a good time for David’s Bridal to pay off their debts. Wholesale shopping from Asia and other places have gotten very popular from reviews and Youtube videos, which has given them more exposure. The exposure then tends to lead consumers to the most affordable choice, which may not be David’s Bridal. The rapid changes of popular styles and fads may also impact consumers buying from David’s Bridal. David’s Bridal is capable of lowering their debt enough to suffice closing stores.

The company has more than $400 million in debt as of Monday.  David’s Bridals started as an individual bridal salon in Florida in 1950 and quickly expanded. In 2012, Clayton, Dubilier and Rice purchased the company in a 1.05 billion leveraged buyout, which made them one of the many retailers that have struggled with their debt loads after being acquired. The decline in marriage rates is factor which played apart in the growing debts. Online competition and wholesale prices, have driven customers away David’s Bridal. Before taking steps to declare bankruptcy, David’s Bridal negotiated a deal with creditors for $60 million in new financing and a recommitment for a $125 million revolving credit facility.  Stores have not been announced to close as of yet, and the company plans to exit bankruptcy in early January.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">David’s Bridal is an amazing store; my mother even had bought her wedding dress from there. I think that the business in weddings is very delicate and unpredictable, where as there may be good business one season and bad another. Due to this fact, I feel it may take a good time for David’s Bridal to pay off their debts. Wholesale shopping from Asia and other places have gotten very popular from reviews and Youtube videos, which has given them more exposure. The exposure then tends to lead consumers to the most affordable choice, which may not be David’s Bridal. The rapid changes of popular styles and fads may also impact consumers buying from David’s Bridal. David’s Bridal is capable of lowering their debt enough to suffice closing stores. I think the steps they have taken, such as the deal with creditors for new financing and recommitment, demonstrate the companies drive to fix their financial standings.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/19\/business\/davids-bridal-bankruptcy.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/19\/business\/davids-bridal-bankruptcy.html<\/a><\/p>",

This decrease had led to an intense discussion within the Federal Reserve on what steps to take next given recently troubled circumstances, in particular, the nation's interest rates. “Fed officials have signaled in recent days they plan to proceed with another quarter percentage point increase in their benchmark short-term interest rate when they meet Dec. 19, marking their fourth rate increase this year”. However, some data shown in the last Fed’s meeting have split the team in half regarding the decision to raise interest rates.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>“The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply Tuesday to its sixth drop in eight trading days, a move that has wiped out its gains for the year”. Given these stock troubles, investors are worried the raised interest rate can lead to an “economic weakness in the US and abroad” then what Fed officials may be able to count on. Important individuals such as Stanley Druckenmiller, investor, hedge fund manager, and a philanthropist, are vocalizing the need for the Fed to slow down and to simply observe the market before securing a decision. Then there is Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, LP, who “argued that the Fed’s interest-rate hikes will hurt asset prices and that such share weakness will, in turn, undercut the economy”. These opinions were then heavily complicated by our President, Donald Trump, who downright went to central banks to campaign for the need to halt interest rate increases. His response to this matter, “ I’d like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate. We have much more of a Fed problem than we have a problem with anyone else.”<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s response to this is that “market conditions are “one of many factors” the Fed considers when deciding where to set its benchmark rates”. Otherwise, there have been heated debates within the walls of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Wall Street, Morgan Stanley, Nomura Securities about this matter, so now all there is to do is wait and see the outcome of this case.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/federal-reserve-not-likely-swayed-by-recent-stock-market-declines-1542747329?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/federal-reserve-not-likely-swayed-by-recent-stock-market-declines-1542747329?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2<\/a><\/div>",

Since then various Toys 'R' Us stores have been shut down around America and the company liquidated its shares and sold its Canadian, European, and Asian units to other groups. However even after this recent tragedy, “the newly independent Toys ‘R’ Us Asia” has seen a recent boom in popularity. “The surviving Asian operation spans more than 450 stores in 10 markets, with 168 in Japan and 166 China” focusing on a smaller store layout of 10,000 square feet, often located inside malls, compared to the old gigantic American Layout of 40,000 square feet.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>Toys 'R' Us Asia has reported a loss in revenue for 4 years till 2016, but in 2017 the company emphasized its positive growth, nevertheless, this does not mean the company is in the green light for upcoming years. Asian “e-commerce giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com have taken a huge swath of China’s retail market. More people bought toys, games, and books online than from specialist children’s retail stores in the second half of last year, according to a study of 3,000 internet users by Mintel”. To redirect customers attention to brick and mortar stores like Toys 'R'` Us, they themselves have to now be extra careful of the way they present themselves to the Asian consumers to keep the steady profit going. The stores’ focuses are on “development-related toys, as parents become more focused on their children’s education” and also “in-store activities” to engage parents and children into this buying experience. The new independent Toys 'R' Us Asia is going through a new period of change after its recent incidents to rebrand itself and to again establish themselves into a stable market.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/toys-r-us-gears-up-for-holiday-salesin-asia-1543062604?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/toys-r-us-gears-up-for-holiday-salesin-asia-1543062604?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1<\/a><\/div>",

This government crackdown threatened both Juul and other e-cigarette producers, and the company has already agreed to stop retailing many of its flavored products like mango and crème pods due to their underage appeal.  Despite this discontinuation the FDA is still out for blood, investigating the company’s marketing strategy and even product design to discover the underage appeal and help prevent teenage use.\r\n\r\nCurrently, The Altria Group, a large tobacco company that produces traditional cigarettes such as Marlboro, is in negotiations to buy minority stake in Juul Labs.

Altria is currently worth $103 billion, falling about 13 percent in the last year.

Other days it’s been a bottle of Nyquil pills for the migraine I’ve been having. Either way, I’ve never seen CVS as anything other than my milk supply and Medicare. This is because CVS is a household image known for tools needed by the average man. Recently, however, in an article I read, “CVS Completes $70 Billion Acquisition of Aetna” it plans to expand their horizons and acquire a more significant and powerful vision. CVS HealthCorp. completed its nearly $70 billion acquisition of Aetna Inc.,forging a new industry giant and starting the clock ticking on ambitious goals of curbing health-care costs and improving consumers’ experience. In an interview, CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said the merged company has the right combination to smooth the fragmented health-care experience for consumers. “We have the capabilities to connect the dots in a very differentiated way,” he said. However, the combined company faces significant challenges in bringing together its diverse set of health assets, including CVS’s sprawling network of pharmacies, a pharmacy-benefit manager and Aetna’s employer insurance, Medicare and Medicaid managed-care businesses. Aetna will be operated as a stand-alone unit, and CVS will continue using the brand in reference to its insurance products.\r\n\r\nIt's important to branch out and diversify, moreover it’s admirable to have an entrepreneurial vision. While it may have the glory, achieving these goals can be so expensive one might not even break even. It’s important to take risks but calculated as well. Amalgamating two businesses together needs to be a smooth transition, just like two families. The new merger may not have been as optimistic as Larry Merlo had aspired it to be, but it still has an immense scope.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/cvs-completes-70-billion-acquisition-of-aetna-1543423322\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/cvs-completes-70-billion-acquisition-of-aetna-1543423322<\/a>",

Other days it’s been a bottle of Nyquil pills for the migraine I’ve been having. Either way, I’ve never seen CVS as anything other than my milk supply and Medicare. This is because CVS is a household image known for tools needed by the average man. Recently, however, in an article I read, “CVS Completes $70 Billion Acquisition of Aetna” it plans to expand their horizons and acquire a more significant and powerful vision. CVS HealthCorp. completed its nearly $70 billion acquisition of Aetna Inc.,forging a new industry giant and starting the clock ticking on ambitious goals of curbing health-care costs and improving consumers’ experience. In an interview, CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said the merged company has the right combination to smooth the fragmented health-care experience for consumers. “We have the capabilities to connect the dots in a very differentiated way,” he said. However, the combined company faces significant challenges in bringing together its diverse set of health assets, including CVS’s sprawling network of pharmacies, a pharmacy-benefit manager and Aetna’s employer insurance, Medicare and Medicaid managed-care businesses. Aetna will be operated as a stand-alone unit, and CVS will continue using the brand in reference to its insurance products.\r\n\r\nIt's important to branch out and diversify, moreover it’s admirable to have an entrepreneurial vision. While it may have the glory, achieving these goals can be so expensive one might not even break even. It’s important to take risks but calculated as well. Amalgamating two businesses together needs to be a smooth transition, just like two families. The new merger may not have been as optimistic as Larry Merlo had aspired it to be, but it still has an immense scope.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/cvs-completes-70-billion-acquisition-of-aetna-1543423322\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/cvs-completes-70-billion-acquisition-of-aetna-1543423322<\/a>",

Customers are expected to open their wallets as wage growth is picking up and the unemployment rate is at the lowest it has been in nearly half a century. Therefore, retailers should be ecstatic about the high consumer confidence and expected 4.1 percent increase in holiday spending in comparison to last year. Although last year’s holiday season was the best for retailers in more than a decade, Americans are feeling even better this year with the economy on track for its best annual performance since 2005, sharp decline in gas prices, and recent tax cuts. However, the combination of rising interest rates, a weakening housing market, and new tariffs set to take place in January means the economy could begin to slow in 2019.

Also, the decline in the stock market along with the decreasing housing market indicates bad news in the foreseeable future.

This government crackdown threatened both Juul and other e-cigarette producers, and the company has already agreed to stop retailing many of its flavored products like mango and crème pods due to their underage appeal.  Despite this discontinuation the FDA is still out for blood, investigating the company’s marketing strategy and even product design to discover the underage appeal and help prevent teenage use.\r\n\r\nCurrently, The Altria Group, a large tobacco company that produces traditional cigarettes such as Marlboro, is in negotiations to buy minority stake in Juul Labs. Right now Juul Labs is privately owned, so they don’t have shareholder funds to fall back on. If the negotiations work out Altria will have a greater foothold into the e-cigarette market and Juul will have access to the funding it needs to fight back against the FDA. A win for both companies. Altria is currently worth $103 billion, falling about 13 percent in the last year. With a decline in traditional smoking and a rise in e-cigarettes and vapes, an investment into Juul’s share of the market will become essential for Altria to uphold its value.\r\n\r\nTobacco prevention advocates are speaking out against this buy in because of Altria’s history of trying to lure in teen smokers. Pumping this money into the e-cigarette market will be a massive setback for anti-smoking efforts. Juul dominates 70 percent of the e-cigarette market right now, and with an investment buy Altria that share will only continue to grow.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/28\/business\/altria-juul-stake.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/28\/business\/altria-juul-stake.html<\/a>",

The actions of American executives can always be assessed by how they impact the stock market. According to New York Times article, “Trump Warns China That He’s ‘Tariff Man,’ Spooking Stock Investors”, by Matt Phillips and Alan Rappeport, President Trump met with the President of China, Xi Jinping, on December 3rd , 2018. American officials reported that the meeting was successful as the two parties agreed to stop the trade war by not levying more tariffs for 90 days. The article states that the countries will, “work toward a formal agreement.” Investors saw this event as a positive and as a result there was a rise in the stock market. Then, on Tuesday, December 4, 2018, President Trump tweeted, “....I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so.” This tweet wiped out all the confidence created on Monday and the stock market began to decline. More specifically, the S&amp;P 500 declined more than three percent and a large company such as Boeing fell 4.9 percent (Phillips and Rappeport). The events of the past two days clearly signal that the trade war between China and the United States will continue and a long-term agreement is may not happen.\r\n\r\nThe authors express deeper concerns with the stock market as it is showing signs of a possible recession in the near future. If the trend of the stock market continues then the interest rates on long-term United States government bonds will fall below short-term US government bonds. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, this type of activity has led to, “nine recessions since 1955.” The global economy is in a generally declining with the exception of the United States. Since the United States is a major party in global trade, it is expected that the American economy will also fall. President Trump is a self-proclaimed economic genius, but engaging in a trade war is never beneficial to the economy.\r\n\r\nIf the United States and China reach a long-term trade agreement, then the world economy would likely recover. Investors will regain their confidence and the stock market will rise. The true legacy of a president is determined by their economic achievements. As of today, unemployment is historically low and the economy is set to have its best year since 2005\r\n(Phillips and Rappeport). If President Trump’s trade war continues then the economy will likely fall again and future presidents will be faced with finding a solution. The legacy of those presidents will be based on their ability to solve the economic problem. As New Yorkers, we have to be wary of a recession. We are at the center of American economy and any economic hardships of the country always have a detrimental effect on the city. The general attitude of the people would be bitter and hostile. For now, we can watch the economy flourish and hope that a possible recession can be avoided.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/12\/04\/business\/yield-curve-recession-stock-market.html?fbclid=IwAR1a2-kXWHgInkj18c137JTcX-qaljExrE3HMuH7CazX7qdC6cNAGSHUFwk\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/12\/04\/business\/yield-curve-recession-stock-market.html?fbclid=IwAR1a2-kXWHgInkj18c137JTcX-qaljExrE3HMuH7CazX7qdC6cNAGSHUFwk<\/a>",

Amazon has consistently been able to take over many industries. Its ability to provide free 2 day shipping on most products, a streaming and music service, and 2 hour delivery from local supermarkets for its subscription makes the typical American feel like they are in good hands. Most things that people might want to buy, furniture, electronics, school supplies, most likely have a cheaper option on <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\"><span class=\"s2\">amazon.com<\/span><\/a>. Recently, Amazon has been diving into the clothing business as they are attempting to provide good quality yet affordable clothing to the average consumer. In addition to their expansion into other industries, Jeff Bezos, the founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\"><span class=\"s2\">amazon.com<\/span><\/a>, made the decision to dive into the health and medicine industry. Right off the bat, getting the correct medicine delivered to anyone will make many family’s lives easier. Amazon is working with an app developed by Xealth Inc. that enables doctors to choose medical supplies to recommend to patients and to direct them to a website that links to <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\"><span class=\"s2\">amazon.com<\/span><\/a>, where anyone is able to order it. “We’re looking for ways to make that more convenient,” says Glenn Updike, an obstetrician at the UPMC health system in Pittsburgh who has sent the digital referrals and is a technology official at the health system. The app alerts patients with a pop-up disclaimer that buying products is a recommendation only. Amazon outlines how it collects data from users in its privacy policies. Xealth says the app doesn’t share with Amazon any information in a patient’s medical records or about the doctor treating the patient. I think this is a great step for Amazon. They can definitely take on this challenge and take over another industry. Also, It will now be easier for me and my family to get the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  <\/span>medicine we need when we are busy which is a plus. However, I fear for the power Amazon has. They are on top of every industry, which makes me wonder how they can use that to their advantage while putting us, the consumers, as risk. Higher prices for us come with the amount of power that Amazon has. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-makes-inroads-selling-medical-supplies-to-the-sick-1543487401?emailToken=0ee81b8a4b33d24ea44f1541b15957b2AVtNY%2002UJF%204YSsKxZ%2FJb0D6Kff0nCgetCShcxtu6F7l6r6QsvELJ8VxrYqWYSS%2F8DXpDNFysDWrwp4gPc2%20CVp%2Fx82qo9uxfEr5tCv6XtRvsSjQTeio0w95iToauNQ&amp;reflink=article_imessage_share&amp;fbclid=IwAR1QwbgIjchLhUcmDHuKAqomKosB1dq2h1zegZ1x0POERYC-4P5vvzz-YYs\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-makes-inroads-selling-medical-supplies-to-the-sick-1543487401?emailToken=0ee81b8a4b33d24ea44f1541b15957b2AVtNY%2002UJF%204YSsKxZ%2FJb0D6Kff0nCgetCShcxtu6F7l6r6QsvELJ8VxrYqWYSS%2F8DXpDNFysDWrwp4gPc2%20CVp%2Fx82qo9uxfEr5tCv6XtRvsSjQTeio0w95iToauNQ&amp;reflink=article_imessage_share&amp;fbclid=IwAR1QwbgIjchLhUcmDHuKAqomKosB1dq2h1zegZ1x0POERYC-4P5vvzz-YYs<\/a><\/p>",

Mainly people who are looking to live or stay and explore what the city has to offer. New York City is known across the world for the shopping, eating, and walking sprees you do when you’re here. Rich people have realized the abundance of people who are coming in to make a living or just stay for the weekend. Therefore, luxury hotels are being built in order to accommodate the population of New York City. However, the city is unique because of the various types of apartment buildings and stores it has to offer. The administration of New York City realizes this and wants to keep the history and uniqueness in tact, rather than having the city filled with mainly luxury hotels which therefore leads the area that the hotels are located in to be pricey for most people. So, they created a proposal which limits the number of hotels that are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city. Wealthy hotel owners are fighting this because they realize the advantage they can take over the tourists and people that want to live in the city. They recognize the money they are able to make off of these people. I stand with the government of New York City on this one. I believe the uniqueness and history of the city should be preserved as much as it can, and if there are no guidelines and rules to follow regarding real estate, wealthy building owners will just continue to use their money towards more residential buildings.<\/span>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/hotel-developers-fight-nyc-proposal-that-would-reduce-new-building-1543320005\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/hotel-developers-fight-nyc-proposal-that-would-reduce-new-building-1543320005<\/a>",

Mainly people who are looking to live or stay and explore what the city has to offer. New York City is known across the world for the shopping, eating, and walking sprees you do when you’re here. Rich people have realized the abundance of people who are coming in to make a living or just stay for the weekend. Therefore, luxury hotels are being built in order to accommodate the population of New York City. However, the city is unique because of the various types of apartment buildings and stores it has to offer. The administration of New York City realizes this and wants to keep the history and uniqueness in tact, rather than having the city filled with mainly luxury hotels which therefore leads the area that the hotels are located in to be pricey for most people. So, they created a proposal which limits the number of hotels that are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city. Wealthy hotel owners are fighting this because they realize the advantage they can take over the tourists and people that want to live in the city. They recognize the money they are able to make off of these people. I stand with the government of New York City on this one. I believe the uniqueness and history of the city should be preserved as much as it can, and if there are no guidelines and rules to follow regarding real estate, wealthy building owners will just continue to use their money towards more residential buildings.<\/span>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/hotel-developers-fight-nyc-proposal-that-would-reduce-new-building-1543320005\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/hotel-developers-fight-nyc-proposal-that-would-reduce-new-building-1543320005<\/a>",

Leading Europe’s third-largest economy, President Macron has gradually developed a public persona of perseverance and determination since taking office in May 2017 to achieve France’s economic goals and maintain the country’s status as an influential world power. However, the optimism of President Macron’s leadership and France’s economic image has taken a significant beaten over the past four weeks with the emergence of violent protests by the Yellow Vest movement.\r\n\r\nBeginning as a public outcry over plans to implement a new gas tax to reduce France’s carbon emissions, the Yellow Vests movement has transformed into a collective rebuke of President Macron’s policies and his failure to address concerns of an increase in the high cost of living and tax cuts for big business and wealthy individuals. Protests and demonstrations have\r\nbecome increasingly violent and destructive, with protestors flipping over and burning cars, looting and damaging buildings, and clashing with police on the streets. These protests have resulted in estimated damages and lost revenues exceeding ten million euros, about $11.4 billion, as stated in the New York Times article “Unrest in France Hinders Macron’s Push to Revive\r\nEconomy” by Liz Alderman. Additionally, the Bank of France has reduced the country’s estimated fourth-quarter growth from 0.4% to 0.2%. Foreign investors are scared to continue investing into France’s economy during this turbulent period as industries like tourism, agriculture, and retail face enormous losses and setbacks as a result of the violent protestors shutting down roads and businesses. Even though President Macron has announced the elimination of the planned gas tax and promised certain financial measures to help lower-class individuals, these promises do very little for the majority of the protestors who reside in rural areas of the country and are faced with increasing living costs and taxes. President Macron has stubbornly refused to ease up on his business-friendly measures to incentivize business investments by eliminating regulations and providing tax breaks. Such stubborn refusal is further cause for concern that the protests may continue longer and become increasingly violent if new measures are taken.\r\n\r\nPresident Macron has significantly damaged his reputation and approval rating among French voters as someone who cares about the middle-class. By providing more concern and resources for immigrants and large businesses instead of financially-struggling French citizens, President Macron is allowing France’s budget to drastically increase while promoting unrest. This unrest has led to Marie Le Pen, the president of France’s far-right National Rally party, to increase in popularity to become the country new president in the next general election. Furthermore, with investors pulling millions out of France and reinvesting into other countries like the United States and China, the EU is facing a further risk of collapsing. To survive such an outcome, President Macron needs to become serious about the issues and concerns of the people of French to save the economy and country.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/12\/11\/business\/france-economy-macron.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/12\/11\/business\/france-economy-macron.html<\/a>",

According to WSJ “insurers, conglomerates and other big investors from China sold $1.05 billion worth of U.S. real estate in the third quarter, while purchasing $231 million of property”.

However, the recent purchasing power has seen a down low compared to the first two quarters since 2017. Purchasing powers of 2017, first and second quarters were met with good results with the amount of purchase going well beyond $1.7 billion to $4 billion and on the first quarter of 2018 amount of purchase skyrocketing beyond $4 billion. But the third quarter results of 2018 have been tragically low with purchases of only $231 million. The reason for this steep decrease can be described by the “rising corporate debt levels and concern over currency stability [that] led the Chinese government to tighten capital outflows and clamp down on their companies’ overseas acquisitions” and also by the “trade tension between Beijing and Washington, D.C.”.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>“The Chinese conglomerate purchased the eight-acre parcel in 2014 for $420 million and had planned to develop luxury condominiums and a boutique hotel on the site”<\/div>\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/chinese-dumped-1-billion-of-u-s-real-estate-in-third-quarter-extending-recent-retreat-1543924802\">https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/chinese-dumped-1-billion-of-u-s-real-estate-in-third-quarter-extending-recent-retreat-1543924802<\/a>",

Ten years ago, Bernard Madoff’s multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, the biggest fraud in U.S. history, shocked the financial world. It soon emerged that a forensic accountant, Harry Markopolos, had been alerting regulators for years to Mr. Madoff’s fraud, but no one had listened. At Mr. Markopolos’s urging, the Securities and Exchange Commission created a cash-for-tips program, designed to encourage reports of financial wrongdoing and prevent the lapses in oversight that gave Mr. Madoff free rein.

Whistleblower Inc. is the most tangible consequence of the Madoff scandal a decade after the money manager’s Dec. 11, 2008 arrest. Critics say the deluge of those seeking rewards is now overwhelming the system. More than 5,200 tips have been filed this year, compared to 3,000 in 2012. About 53% of all reward requests remain undecided, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of SEC figures and data obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request. It takes the SEC about two years to decide if a whistleblower’s tip merits a reward, according to a sample of whistleblower award decisions analyzed by The Wall Street Journal. In some cases, the wait is much longer. Ethics are important, in business and especially in life.

A main aspect in that expansion includes new $1 billion campus in Austin. The Austin campus will hold a lot of responsibility, including many crucial corporate decisions off how to advance the company as well as engineering and customer support for the company. Also, like other Apple facilities, this facility will run on 100 percent renewable energy. This 133-acre development is expected to make it the largest private employer in Austin. Where a headquarters is located is important because not only does it attract many people to an area through curiosity, but it also brings business to any certain area. Cities should want to hold a headquarters of a big company such as Apple. Apple expects the new campus to accommodate 5,000 employees at first, though it will ultimately have a total capacity of 15,000. I think expanding into different areas is great because it creates more jobs for people to hold as well as expands their whole company. However, the Texas Enterprise Fund said it will give Apple a “65% tax break annually”. In addition, they plan to give apple some money to help the project go along more smoothly. Many people are upset by this because they think it is unfair for such a big, powerful and rich company get a tax break when there are schools and public places in Texas and Austin that are suffering and closing down because they do not have enough money to stay open.

    "post_content": "Patrick Perrigo\r\n\r\n12\/16\/18\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/President-Macron-Televised-Speech.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-787\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mhcbusiness.nyc\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/President-Macron-Televised-Speech-300x229.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"511\" height=\"390\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWith German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepping down in 2021 and an increase in foreign investments in particular European sectors, France’s President Emmanuel Macron appeared to become the next unifier and leader of the European Union during a period of uncertainty as far-right populism and Russian aggression challenges the stability and efficiency of the EU. Leading Europe’s third-largest economy, President Macron has gradually developed a public persona of perseverance and determination since taking office in May 2017 to achieve France’s economic goals and maintain the country’s status as an influential world power. However, the optimism of President Macron’s leadership and France’s economic image has taken a significant beaten over the past four weeks with the emergence of violent protests by the Yellow Vest movement.\r\n\r\nBeginning as a public outcry over plans to implement a new gas tax to reduce France’s carbon emissions, the Yellow Vests movement has transformed into a collective rebuke of President Macron’s policies and his failure to address concerns of an increase in the high cost of living and tax cuts for big business and wealthy individuals. Protests and demonstrations have\r\nbecome increasingly violent and destructive, with protestors flipping over and burning cars, looting and damaging buildings, and clashing with police on the streets. These protests have resulted in estimated damages and lost revenues exceeding ten million euros, about $11.4 billion, as stated in the New York Times article “Unrest in France Hinders Macron’s Push to Revive\r\nEconomy” by Liz Alderman. Additionally, the Bank of France has reduced the country’s estimated fourth-quarter growth from 0.4% to 0.2%. Foreign investors are scared to continue investing into France’s economy during this turbulent period as industries like tourism, agriculture, and retail face enormous losses and setbacks as a result of the violent protestors shutting down roads and businesses. Even though President Macron has announced the elimination of the planned gas tax and promised certain financial measures to help lower-class individuals, these promises do very little for the majority of the protestors who reside in rural areas of the country and are faced with increasing living costs and taxes. President Macron has stubbornly refused to ease up on his business-friendly measures to incentivize business investments by eliminating regulations and providing tax breaks. Such stubborn refusal is further cause for concern that the protests may continue longer and become increasingly violent if new measures are taken.\r\n\r\nPresident Macron has significantly damaged his reputation and approval rating among French voters as someone who cares about the middle-class. By providing more concern and resources for immigrants and large businesses instead of financially-struggling French citizens, President Macron is allowing France’s budget to drastically increase while promoting unrest. This unrest has led to Marie Le Pen, the president of France’s far-right National Rally party, to increase in popularity to become the country new president in the next general election. Furthermore, with investors pulling millions out of France and reinvesting into other countries like the United States and China, the EU is facing a further risk of collapsing. To survive such an outcome, President Macron needs to become serious about the issues and concerns of the people of French to save the economy and country.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/12\/11\/business\/france-economy-macron.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/12\/11\/business\/france-economy-macron.html<\/a>",
